## Limits of RDBMS
- scalability
	- it might be possible to scale traditional RDB to multi-terabyte or single-petabyte scale but it is very complex, costly
- speed
	- some of the projects have different needs around speed
	- RDB not built for the speeds required to bring the data in
- Queryability
	- querying all the data might not be performant
- sophisticated processing like ML
- db choices now include even filesystems
	- then there are NoSQL dbs as a choice
		- these are groups of dbs categorized such as key-value stores(Redis), column stores, doc dbs(MongoDb) or graph dbs
- some implementations of portions of HDFS could be categorized as NoSQL
	- hadoop itself is not a DB
	- HD is a fs with a processing lib
- hadoop is not a replacement for RDBMS
- hadoop ecosys is designed to solve a diff set of data problems than those solved by rdb
- HDFS is a replacement of the FS we had been using
- hadoop is most commonly implemented with HBase
- HDFS based on GFS(so similar)
- HBase is a NoSQL db that is very commonly used with hadoop solutions
	- it is a wide column store
	- means that it is a db consisting of a key and then one to N num of values
