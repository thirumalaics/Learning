## What is Azure Synapse Analytics
- four common types of analytical techniques that organizations commonly use:
- what is analytics: is the process of discovering, interpreting, and communicating significant patterns in data
- descriptive analytics: which explains what is happening
	- the data to answer this question is housed in a DWH
- diagnostic analytics: answers the question Why is it happening?
	- may involve exploring info that already exists in the DWH

- ASA provides a cloud pf for all of these analytical wls
	- a single, integrated solution, by supporting multiple
		 - data storage, processing, analysis techs
- requires skills in SQL, Spark

## How ASA works
- ASA combines a centralized service for data storage and processing with a extensible architecture
	- so mainly centralized service for ds and dp
- through extensible architecture, linked services enable us to integrate commonly used data stores, processing p/fs and visualization tools

## Creating and using an ASA Workspace
- ASAWS defines an instance of Synapse analytics service
	- in which we can manage the services and data resources needed for us
- SAWS can be created within a Subscription through UI, APowerShell, ACLI, AResource Manager or Bicep Template
- after creating, we can manage the services in it and perform data analytics tasks with them by using Synapse Studio
