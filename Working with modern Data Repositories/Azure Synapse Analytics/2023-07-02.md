## Integrating with other Adata services(ADS)
- ASA can be integrated with other ADS
	- why integration required?: end-to-end analytics solns
- integrated solns include:
	- ASynapse Link(ASL): enables near-real-time sync b/w (operational data in many MS services) and (analytical ds) that can be queried in ASA
		- these MS services include:
			- ACosmos DB: fully managed NoSQL(major) and rdb(only postgres) for modern app dev
			- ASQL DB: FM RDB-service
			- SQL Server(MS), Microsoft Power Platform Dataverse(to securely store and manage data used by BA)
	- MS Power BI
		- unified, scalable p/f for self-service and enterprise BI 	
			- BI: s/w that ingests data and presents it in user-friendly views such as reports, dashboards, charts and graphs
		- enables DAs to integrate a Power BI ws into a SWS and perform interactive data visualization in Azure-Synapse-Studio(ASS)
	- MS Purview:
		- Data Governance(DG) soln to help manage and govern our on-prem, multicloud, and SAAS data
		- enables orgs to catalog data assets in ASA
		- makes it easier for DEs to find data assets and track lineages when implementing data pps that ingest data into ASA
	- AML:
		- enables DAs and DSs to integrate predictive model training and consumption into analytical solns

## When to use ASA
- the following needs can be addressed using ASA
- large-scale dwhing
	- integrate all data
	- for analytics and reporting purposes from a descriptive analytics perspective
- advanced analytics
	- for predictive analytics
		- using both native features of ASA and integrated features such as AML
- data exploration and discovery
	- the serverless SQL fnality allows different data people to explore the data
- real-time analytics
	- ASA can capture, store and analyze data in real-time or near-real-time
		- enabled by features such as ASL, AStream-Analytics and [ADE]([[Wings/Working with modern Data Repositories/Azure Synapse Analytics/2023-06-30#Exploring data with Data Explorer|2023-06-30]])
- data integration
	- AS pps enables us to ingest, prepare, model and serve the data to be used by downstream sys
- integrated analytics
	- removes the complexity in performing multiple types of analytics
	- one service that enables all analytics
