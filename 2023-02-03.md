## Numeric vals as facts or attr:
- some numeric values might be ambiguous as both dim attr or facts
	- ex: product price
	- if the numeric val used primarily for calc purposes - > fact
	- if the val is stable and is considered for filtering or grouping - > dim
- in some cases it would be better to model the numeric val as both dim attr and fact

## Lag/Duration facts
- [[2023-01-24#Accummulating Snapshot fact tables]] capture process milestones and respective timestamp, date foreign key
- business users might want to analyze lag/duration b/w these milestones
- some lags might be calculated based on more complicated business rules
- in lag/duration facts:
	- every possible milestone's lag w.r.t to start time of that WF
	- stored as a separate column for each milestone
	- query complexity reduced for the end user

## Header/Line Facts
- operation txn sys often consist of a txn header
	- that is associated with many txn lines
- header/line schema = parent/child schemas
	- all the header level dimension foreign keys and degenerate dimensiosns should be included on the line level fact table

## Allocated facts
- common in header/line txn data to encounter facts of diff granularity
	- freight charge
- good practice to allocate header facts down to the line level based on rules provided by the business
	- this allows the facts to be rolled up by all the dims
- design header-level facts only if it delivers query performance adv

## Profit/Loss fact tables using allocation
- fact tables that expose full equation of profit  = one of the most powerful deliverables of an EDWH
- profits = revenue - costs
- fact tables ideally implement the profit equation at atomic grain
	- makes it possible for anlazying on different levels
- diff to build
	- because the cost compo must be allocated from their original sources to the fact table's grain
- This allocation step is often a major ETL subsystem and is a politically charged step that requires high level executive support. 
	- For these reasons, profit and loss fact tables are typically not tackled during the early implementation phases of a DW/BI program

## Multiple currency facts
- fact tables that record financial txns in multiple currencies should contain two mandatory columns
	- 1 for fact in the original currency
	- 2nd for fact in std curr that is used throughout
- std curr value created in an ETL process accd to business rules
- this fact table must have a currency dim to identify the txn's true curr
