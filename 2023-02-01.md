## Type 3:
- add a new attr
	- will only store the original value and the recent value
	- not the in b/w history 
- new val goes in a separate column
- we can either filter w.r.t original or current val
- used very rarely
- not for frequent changes
## type 4:
- add new dim
- used when a group of attrs in a dim are rapidly changing
	- split off to a new dim
- this situation is called sometimes rapidly changing monster dimension
- frequently **used** dim attrs in multimillion row dim tables are a candidate for mini dim design
	- even if they do not **change** frequently
- type 4 mini dim needs it's own PK
- PK of dim and the mini dim are captured in the fact table

## type 5
![[2023-01-31#type 1:]]
- add mini dim and type 1 outrigger
- reference in ft is used to accurately preserve historic attr values
- reference in dt to report historical facts w.r.t current attr values
- builds on the type4 by embedding a type 1 reference from base dim to mini dim
- logically the base and outrigger mini dim are represented as one in the presentation area
- ETL team must overwrite the type 1 mini dim **reference(FK in base dim)** whenever the current mini dim assignment changes
	- mini dim is where the historic and current values are stored

## Type 6
- add type 1 attr to type 2 dim(active flag/date) and type 3 extra attr
- delivers both historical and current dim attr values
- builds on type 2 by also embedding current(val) type 1 versions of the same attr

- one col to represent current val
	- this col contains the current val for all rows with the same NK
- One for last val
	- last valid value
	- for the current row, current_val col = last_val col

## Type 7
- dual type 1 and type 2 dims
- support both as was and as is reporting
- both the natural and surrogate key are placed in the Fact table

- two separate views
- join with current view with the natural key
- join with historical view with the surrogate key
- current and historical data stored as a dim type2 but view created has only current values
