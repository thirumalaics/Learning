## Back room administration of Dual date/time stamps
- for a given customer, the date/timestamps on the sequene of txns must have no gaps
- might be tempting to make the end effective date a second or minute less than the effective start date of the next txn
	- in this case we can use BETWEEN
	- but it might casue issue if the txn could fall within the gap
	- by making end effective date of one txn == start effective date of the next, we eliminate the risk
- whenever a new txn row is entered, using the pair of DTS requires a two-step process
	1. the end effective date/timestamp of the most current txn must be set to a fictitious date/time in the future
		- convention might be null, but in this case they might cause issues when we encounter them in constraints
			- they might cause database error, when we ask if the field is equal to a specific value
	2. after new txn is entered, the etl proc must retrieve the previous txn and set its end effective date/time to the date/time of the newly entered txn

## Tagging FT with satisfaction indicators
- profitability might be the most important key performance indicator
- customer satisfaction is second
	- no.1 for organizations without profit metrics
		- ex: government
- virtually every customer facing process is a potential source of satisfaction information
- satisfaction can be either numeric or textual
- numeric measures of satisfaction
	- ex: num of product returns, num of lost customers, num of support calls
- for airlines :

## Tagging FTs with Abnormal scenario indicators
- ASS FTs capture steps that are standard
- but if an occasional situation deviates from the standard scenario, we don't have a good way to reveal what happened
	- ex: when the order was shipped, the delivery truck had a flat tire and followed by a chain of events that lead to law suit
- the above scenarios cannot be modeled in the standard scenario nor they should be
- the way to describe unusual departures from std scenario is to add **a delivery status dim** to the acc ss FT
- we can fill the order fulfillment row with status weird
- if the analyst wants to see the complete story, join to a companion fact table through the o.no and line no
	- this FT has every step of the story
- the txn FT joins to a txn dim
	- which will contain all the details
