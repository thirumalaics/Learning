## Customer Data Integ Approach
- when there are multiple customer facing processes, we need to choose b/w two approaches
	1. one cust dim derived from all the versions of customer source system records
	2. multiple cust dims tied together by conformed attrs

## Master Data management
- creating a single customer dim
- best of all the available customer data sources
- data entry sys often dont incorporate adequate validation rules
- some orgs have MDM sys
	- this takes responsibility for creating and controlling the single enterprise wide customer entity
	- very rare
- it is mostly the reponsibility of the DWH to extract multiple incompatible cust data and build a downstream MDMS

- the attrs in the cust dim should represent the best source available in the enterprise
- a national change of address(NCOA) process should be integrated to ensure address changes are captured
- heavy effort in cust data consolidation goes in cust data matching or dedup logic
	- this involves removing invalids as well
- customer matching involves:
	- address parsing algo
	- enormous lookup dir to validate address elements and postal codes
- there are s/ws for customer matching
- effective cust data cons depends on a balance of accurate data capture in source sys and powerful data cleansing tools in ETL

## Partial conformity of Multiple customer dims
- enterprises build cust knowledge stores that collect all internal and external cust facing data sources
- these sources can vary in granularity and consistency
- in ideal case, we examine all data sources and define a single comprehensive dim which we attach to all the data sources
	- this might be impossible to build in some cases
- conformed dims share one or more specially administered attrs that have the same col names and data values
	- this takes the workload of building a dim with all colls and values as same
	- the specially administered conformed attrs can be planted in each cust dims incrementally and in agile way
- this process can be iteratively done to introduce many special attrs
