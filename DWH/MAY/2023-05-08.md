- the prebuilt models can help identify core BP and associate common dims
- after a few days or weeks studying the std mode, most teams gain enough confidence to want to customize the schema for their --data
- the knowledge that we get by using the pre-built dm can be attained by spending time with the BU
- another problem is that the PBDM have common dim model design flaws
- it is difficult to design a predefined generic model, even if the vendor owns the data capture source code

## Recursive Employee hierarchies
- a common emp char -> emp's manager
- we can simply embed this attr along with the other attrs in the emp dim
- if the BU need more than just the Manager's name, we need more complex structures
- one approach is to include manager's emp key as another FK in the FT
- the manager emp key joint the FT to a role playing emp dim
	- every attr name refers to manager to diff the dim
- this approach associates the emp and their manager whenever a row is inserted to the FT
- BI analyses can easily filter and group by either emp or manager attrs 
- downside of this approach, these dual FKs must be embedded in every FT to support managerial reporting

- another option, include the manager's emp key as an attr on the emp's dim row
- the manager key would join to an outrigger consisting of a role play similar to above
- if the manager's FK in the emp dim is designated as type 2 attr, then new rows would be generated with each manager change
	- depends on how we want to use it

## Change tracking on Embedded Manager key
- when the same manager applies to a large group of emp in the dim approach
	- if the manager's profile changes and if the attr that changed is handled through Type 2-> new row in RPD
	- if the FK in emp dim is type 2, -> new row for the emps who have the same manager as above
	- even if one small attr change -> affects most of the emps
	- this is unnecessary for even the smallest profile change with manager
	- if this was an entire manager change, the above scenario will be reasonable
	- so it is better to include manager's durable nk linked to the RPD limited to just the current row for each manager's DNK
