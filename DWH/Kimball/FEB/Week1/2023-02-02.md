# Dealing with dimensions hierarchies
- diff hierarchies can be modeled with dim

## Fixed depth positional hierarchies
- series of many to one relationships
- number of hierarchy levels should be constant
- levels should have agreed upon names
	- for the following example all the three rules are conformed
	- ex: product to brand to category to department
- hierarchy levels should appear as separate positional attrbs in a **dim table**

## Slightly Ragged/Variable Depth Hierarchies
- do not have fixed number of levels
- range of depth is small
- we can force fit slightly ragged hierarchies into fixed depth
	- separate dimension attr for the max number of levels

## Ragged/Variable Depth hierarchies with Hierarchy bridge tables
- ragged hierarchies with intermediate depth are difficult to model and query
- SQL extensions and OLAP access languages provide some support for recursive parent/child relationships
	- have their limitations
- model a ragged hierarchy with a specially constructed bridge table
- bridge table contains a row for every possible path in the ragged hierarchy
- with bridge table on board std sql is sufficient
	- no need extension
## Ragged/Variable Depth Hierarchies with Pathstring Attrs
- pathstring attrs in dim are alternate to bridge tables
- pathstring attr contains a specially encoded str
	- contains complete path description from the supreme node of a hierarchy to the node that the dim row describes
- many std hierarchy analysis reqs can be handled by std sql
- no rapid substituition of alternative hierarchies or shared ownership hierarchies
- may be vulnerable to structure change in the ragged hierarchy
	- in some cases the entire hierarchy becomes invalid

# Advanced fact table tech
- refer to less common fact table patterns

## Fact table surrogate keys
- surrogate keys usually used to implement the PK of almost all dim tables
- single col surrogate fact keys can be useful in facts
	- not required
- SK not associated with any dim
- assigned sequentially during the ETL load process
- used as the 
	- single column primary key of the fact table
	- immediate identifier of a fact table row without having to navigate multiple dims for ETL purposes
	- to allow an interrupted load process to resume or back off
	- allow fact table updates to be decomposed into less risky inserts plus deletes

## Centipede fact tables
- some designers create separate normalized dims for each level of a many to one hierarchy
	- date dim, month dim,quarter dim, year dim
	- and then include all these foreign keys in a fact table
- results in Centipede fact table
	- with dozens of hierarchically related dims
- should be avoided 
- Centipede fact tables also result when designers embed numerous foreign keys to individual low-cardinality dimension tables rather than creating a [[2023-01-30#Junk dims]].
