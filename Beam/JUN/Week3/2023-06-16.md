## Splittable DoFns
- SDF enables users to create modular components containing I/Os(and some advanced [non I/O use cases](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AQmx-T9XjSi1PNoEp5_L-lT0j7BkgTbmQnc6uFEMI4c/edit#heading=h.5cep9s8k4fxv))
- having modular I/O components that can be connected to each other simplify typical patterns that users want
- ex: popular use case is to read filenames from a message queue followed by parsing those files
- traditionally, users were required to either write a single I/O connector doing both above
	- complex
- another option: choose to reuse a message queue I/O followed by a regular DoFn that read the file(s)
	- low perf
- with SDF, we bring the richness of Apache Beam's I/O APIs to a DoFn enabling modularity while maintaining the performance of traditional I/O connectors

## SDF basics
- at a high level, an SDF is responsible for processing element and restriction pairs
- A restriction represents subset of work which should be done when processing an element
- executing an SDF follows the following steps:
	1. Each element is paired with a restriction (ex: filename is paired with offset range representing the whole file)
	2. each element and restriction pair is split (ex: offset ranges are broken up into smaller pieces)
	3. the runner redistributes the new element and restriction pairs to several workers
	4. Element and restriction pairs are processed in parallel(ex: the file is read). 
		- within this last step, the element and restriction pair can pause its own processing and/or be split into further element and restriction pairs

## A basic SDF
- a basic SDF is composed of three parts:
	- a restriction, a restriction provider, and a restriction tracker
- the restriction is a user-defined object that is used to represent a subset of work for a given element
