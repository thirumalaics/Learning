## Timers vs Windows
- windowing can be implemented by ourselves using timers
- windows are grouping key or a partitioning key and has a max ts
- all state associated with the window can be discarded once wm passes window
- timers for fine grained control with respect to state and what to do with them

## Garbage collecting state
- per-key state needs to be GCed
- 2 common strategies for GCing state

## Using windows for garbage collection
- all state and timers for a key are scoped to the window they are in
	- this means that depending on the timestamp of the input element, the `ParDo` will see different values for the state depending on the window that elements falls into
		- guess it will be reset to no state if the element is from a different window 
			- so if the timer runs past the first window, it should not capture the element that falls into the next window even if it is within the timer
			- when processing that element, the state and timer will be null as new window
- once the i/p wm passes the end of the window, the runner should gc all state for the window
- if allowed lateness is set to a positive value for the window, the runner must wait for the wm to pass the end of the window plus the allowed lateness before gcing state

- does this mean: if the timer expires only after the wm crosses the window, then there are chances for the state stored for the previous timer to be gced?

## Using timers for GC
- in some cases, it is diff to find a windowing strategy that models the desired gc strategy
- common desire is to garbage collect state for a key once no activity has been seen on the key for some time
- this can be done by updating a timer that garbage collects the state
