## Timers
![[Pasted image 20230614172136.png]]
- once the wm passes the timer, we can choose to do some processing
	- this is one of the use cases
- usually used when we want to batch calls to an external server after a certain time
	- all the while collecting some state
- there is a function called `on_timer` which will be called once the timer expires
	- that is where we can do the minibatch processing with the state that we have saved
- in the process element function, we set or update the timer

## Processing-time timers
- fire when real wall-clock time passes
- this is often used to create larger batches of data before processing
- also to schedule events that should occur at a specific time
- processing-time timers are per key
	- each key has a separate copy of the timer
- processing-time timers can be set to an absolute timestamp
	- but common to set them to an offset relative to the current time

## Dynamic timer tags
- Beam supports dynamically setting a timer tag using `TimerMap` in the Java SDK
	- this allows for setting multiple different timers in a DoFn and allowing for the timer tags to be dynamically chosen
		- ex: based on data in the i/p elements
- a timer with a specific tag can only be set to a single timestamp
	- so setting the timer again has the effect of overwriting the previous expiration time for the timer with that tag
- Each TimerMap is identified with a timer family id, and timers in different timer families are independent
- in python SDK, a dynamic timer tag can be specified while calling `set()` or `clear()`
	- by default, the timer tag is an empty string if not specified
