## CombiningState  
- allows us to create a state object that is updated using a Beam Combiner  
- what does combiner mean here?  
- i think they are functions like: sum, min, max  
- the above valueState can be rewritten to use CombiningState  
- sum is the combiner used below

## BagState  
- common use for state is to accumulate multiple elements  
- BS allows to accumulate an unordered set of elements  
- allows addition of elements to the coll without requiring the reading of the entire coll first  
	- efficient  
- runners that support paged reads can allow individual bags larger than the available mem  
	- what is paged reads?

## Deferred State Reads  
- when a DoFn contains multiple state specs, reading each one in order can be slow  
- calling the read() function on a state can cause the runner to perform a blocking read  
- performing multiple such blocking reads in sequence adds latency to element processing  
- if we know that a state will always be read, we can annotate it as @AlwaysFetched  
	- the runner can prefetch all of the states necessary  
- if there are code paths in which the states are not fetched, then annotating with `@AlwaysFetched` will add unnecessary fetching for those paths

- in the above case, all states are read
- the `readLater` method allows the runner to know that the state will be read in the future

- allowing multiple state reads to be batched together  
## Timers  
- beam provides per-key timer callback API  
- this allows for delayed processing of data stored using the state API  
- timers can be set to callback at either an event-time or processing-time ts  
- every timer is identified with a TimerId  
- a given timer for a key can only be set for a single timestamp  
- calling set on a timer overwrites the previous firing time for that key's timer  
  
## Event-time timers  
- fires when the i/p wm for the DoFn passes the time at which the timer is set  
- the runner believes that there are no more elements to be processed with timestamps before the timer timestamp  
- this allows for event-time agg
