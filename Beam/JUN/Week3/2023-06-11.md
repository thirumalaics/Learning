## State and Timers
- for agg use cases for which dev may require a higher degree of control than provided by windows and triggers
- beam provides an API for managing per-key state, allowing for fine-grained control over aggregations
- State API models state per key
- to use it, start out with a keyed PColl
	- in Java is modeled as a PColl\<KV\<K,V\>\>
- a pardo processing this PColl can now declare state vars
- inside the Pardo these state vars can be used to write or update state for the current key
	- or to read previous state written for that key
- state is always fully scoped only to the current processing key
- windowing can still be used together with stateful processing
	- all state for a key is scoped to the current window
	- this means that the first time a key is seen for a given window any state reads will be empty
	- a runner can GC state when a window is completed
- it is also often useful to use Beam's windowed aggs prior to the stateful operator
- merging windows are not supported when using state and timer
- stateful processing is used to implement state-machine style processing
	- tracking state changes?
- care must be taken to remember that the elements in input pcoll have no guaranteed order and to ensure program logic is resilient to this
- unit tests written using the DirectRunner will shuffle the order of element processing
	- reccoed to test for correctness
- a DoFn can declare many state variables
- in Py, DoFn declares states to be accessed by creating `StateSpec` class member variables(class variable of the DoFn, type should be StateSpec ig)
	- reping each state
	- each `StateSpec` is initialized with a name, this name is unique to a ParDo in the graph and has no relation to the other nodes in the graph

## Types of State
#### ValueState
- scalar state value
- for each key in the i/p, VS will store a typed value that can be read and modified inside the DoFn's `ProcessElement` or `OnTimer`
- if the type of the VS has a coder registered, then Beam will automatically infer the coder for the state value
	- coder can be explicitly specified when creating the VS
- VS called as `ReadModifyWriteState` in PySDK
