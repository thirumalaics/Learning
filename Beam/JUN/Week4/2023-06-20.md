- in case of a file, file can be spllitted into several kbs
- runner can decide to split restrictions further on some conditions`

## SDF components
- Restriction: represents a subset of work for a given element
	- no specific class needs to be implemented to represent a restriction
	- we have full control of representing the restriction
- Restriction provider: it lets developers override default implementation used to generate and manipulate restrictions
	- extends from the `RestrictionProvider` base class
	- involves splitting and sizing ops
	- provides the initial restriction
- Restriction tracker: it tracks for which parts of the restriction processing has been completed
	- extends from the `RestrictionTracker` base class
- there are built-in classes in the SDK that can be leveraged when restrictions can be represented as an offset range
	- for files
	- common restrictions are available as pre-built classes

#### Restriction provider
- we must provide an implementation of a restriction provider
- it is mandatory to override the following methods:
`initial_restriction(self, element)`
- it returns the initial restriction for the given element
	- in case of file will return an offset like \[0,size in bytes\]
`create_tracker(self, restriction)`
- it returns a new tracker for the given restriction
	- instance of our tracker
`restriction_size(self,element, restriction)`
- it returns the size of the given restriction, must be a non-negative value
	- runner uses the size returned to make decisions
- other methods that can be overrided:
`restriction_coder(self)`
- it returns a coder for restrictions, only required if it cannot be inferred at runtime
`split(self, element, restriction)`
- enables runner to perform initial splits to increase parallelism
	- it returns an iterator of restrictions
`split_and_size(self,element,restriction)`
- does the same as split but additionally returns the size of each of the splits
`truncate(self,element,restriction)`
- it truncates the provided restriction into a restriction representing a finite amount of work, when the pp is draining
