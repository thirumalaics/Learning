- to address some of the limitations of the above read method, source API was introduced:
- allows reading both bounded and unbounded data sources, in parallel using multiple workers
- it allows checkpointing and resuming reads from unbounded sources
- adv features such as progress reporting and dynamic rebalancing(which together enable autoscaling) for BDS
- supports reporting the source's wm and backlog for unbounded sources
- basically integrates with runner
- cons of source API:
	- coding involves a lot of boilerplate and is error-prone
	- it does not compose well, because a Source can appear only at the root of a pipeline
	- it is not possible to reuse code b/w seemingly very similar bounded and unbounded sources
		- diff APIs for UBS AND BS
	- it is not clear how to satisfy the ingestion of a very large and continuously growing ds
		- do we use BDS or UBS API?
- Source API limitations forced to look for a new solution
	- DoFn as a starting point
		- because they can be applied to both UBS and BS
	- DoFn has a few limitations:
		- Applying a DoFn to a single element is monolithic, especially if the each element is going to be huge
		- Runner interaction: DoFns are a Black box to the Runner
- Splittable DoFn(SDF) is a generalization of a DoFn enabling Apache Beam developers to create modular and composable I/O components. They can also be applied to other advanced non-I/O scenarios
	- highly composable means components can be selected and assembled in various combinations to satisfy specific user requirements

## How does a SDF work?
- the processing of an element by a SDF is decomposed into a number of restrictions(potentially infinite)
- a restriction describes some part of the work to be done for the whole element
- Executing an SDF follows these steps:
	- each element is paired with a restriction(file name paired with offset range representing the whole file)
	- each element's initial restriction is split into smaller restrictions
	- runner distributes element and restriction pairs to several workers
	- element and restriction pairs are processed in parallel. further splitting can be considered by runner
