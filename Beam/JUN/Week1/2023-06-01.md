## Specifying coders
- BSDK require coder for every PCOll in our pipeline
- in most cases, the BSDK is able to automatically infer a Coder for a PColl based on its element type or the transform that produces it
	- in some cases the pp author will need to specify a Coder explicitly
		- or develop a Coder for their Custom type
- BSDK uses a variety of mechanisms when attempting to automatically infer the Coder for a PColl
- BSDK for Py has a `CoderRegistry`
	- represents a mapping of python types to the default coder that should be used for PColls of each type
- By default, BSDK for Py automatically infers the Coder for the elements of an o/p PColl using the type hints from the transform's function object
	- ex DoFn
	- a DoFn with the type hints `@beam.typehints.with_input_types(int)` and `@beam.typehints.with_output_types(str)` accepts an input element of type int and produces an output element of type str
		

## Default Coders and the CoderRegistry
- each pipeline obj has a `CoderRegistry` object
	- which maps language types to the default coder the pipeline should use for those types
	- we can use CoderRegistry obj to look up default coder for a type
	- or to register a new default coder for a given type

## Looking up a default coder
- `CoderRegistry.get_coder` to determine the default Coder for a Py type
- we can use `coders.registry` to access the CR

## Setting the default Coder for a type
- sets at a pipeline level only
- we should obtain and modify the pipeline's `CoderRegistry`
- for obtaining look above
- `CoderRegistry.register_coder` to register a new Coder for the target type
- the following is a builtin coder only

## Windowing
- subdivides a PColl according to the ts of its individual elements
- transforms that agg multiple elements work implicitly on a per-window basis
	- ex: GBK and combine
- triggers: determines when to emit the results of an aggregation as unbounded data arrives
	- we can use triggers to refine the windowing strat for our pp
- triggers allow us to deal with late-arriving data or to provide early results
