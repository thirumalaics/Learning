## Widowing basics
- in the Beam model, any PColl can be subdivided into logical windows
	- each element in a PColl is assigned to one or more windows according to the PColl's windowing function
		- each individual window contains a finite number of elements
	- grouping transforms then consider each PColl's elements on a per-window basis and then per key(if specified)
	- GBK, ex, implicitly groups the elements of a PColl by key and window
- beam's default windowing behavior is to assign all elements of a PColl to a single global window
	- discards late data, even for unbounded PColls
- before we perform a grouping transform on an unbounded PColl, we must do at least one of the following
	- set a non global windowing function
	- set a non-default trigger
		- this allows the global window to emit results under other conditions
			- since the default windowing behavior(waiting for all the data to arrive) will never occur
## Windowing constraints
- window grouping occurs on an as-needed basis
	- if we set a windowing function using the Window transform, each element is assigned to a window
		- but the windows are not considered until GBK or Combine aggregates across a window and key
		- this can have diff effects on our pp

- in the above pipeline, the window applied by Window transform has no effect on ParDo
	- windows are not actually used until they're needed for the GBK

## Windowing with bounded PColls
- we can use windowing with fixed-size data sets in bounded PColls
- windowing considers only the implicit timestamps attached to each element of PColl
	- data sources that create fixed data sets(such as TextIO) assign the same timestamp to every element
	- this means all the elements are by default part of a single global window
- to use windowing with fixed data sets, we can assign our own timestamps to each element
	- to assign timestamps to elements, use ParDo with a DoFn that o/p each element with a new timestamp

- in the above case, the pardo is applied once for every unique key record
	- even if we explicitly did not define a window, there will be a window

- for the above case, ParDo is called once per unique key per window
