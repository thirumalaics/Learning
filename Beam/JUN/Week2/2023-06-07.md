## Setting a trigger
- when we set a windowing function for a PColl by using the `WindowInto` transform, we can also specify a trigger
- the following trigger:
	- emits results one minute after the first element in that window has been processed
	- accumulation mode is also set

## Window Accumulation modes
- when we specify a trigger, we must also set the window's accumulation mode
- when a trigger fires, it emits the **current** contents of the window as a pane
- since a trigger can fire multiple times, the accumulation mode determines whether the system accumulates the window panes as the trigger fires, or discards them
- to set a window to accumulate the panes that are produced when the trigger fires, set the `accumulation_mode` parameter to ACCUMULATING when we set the trigger
	- DISCARDING, to discard fired panes
- ex: 
	- PColl with fixed time windowing and a data-based trigger
		- 10 min window, repeating **trigger that fires every time 3 elements arrive**

- for simplicity, assume the events all arrive in the pipeline in order

#### accumulating mode
- the trigger emits the following values each time it fires

#### Discarding mode

## Handling late data
- to process data that arrives after the wm passes the end of the window
- allowed-lateness is a must 
- this gives our trigger the opportunity to react to the late data
- if allowed-lateness is set, default trigger: emit new results immediately whenever late data arrives

- this allowed-lateness propagates to child pcoll, as windows themselves are propagated
- later we can modify the a-l
