## Event time triggers
- The `AfterWatermark` trigger operates on event time
- the above trigger emits the contents of a window after the watermark passes the end of the window
	- based on the timestamps attached to the data elements
- we can configure triggers that fire if our pipeline receives data before or after the end of the window

## Default trigger
- based on event time
- emits the results of the window when the Beam's wm passes the end of the window for a PColl
- then fires each time late data arrives
- if we use default window config and the default trigger
	- the default trigger emits exactly once
	- late data discarded
	- because the default windowing configuration has an allowed lateness value of 0
		- this can be modified
		- so allowed lateness takes high priority
## Data-driven trigger
- `AfterCount`
- works on element count
- fires after current pane has atleast N elements
- allows for early results
	- especially in a global window
- if we specify AfterCount(50) and only 32 elements arrive, the 32 sit forever
	- if these 32 elements are imp, consider composite triggers
	- so that data does not sit around
