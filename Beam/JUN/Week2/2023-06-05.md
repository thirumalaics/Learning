## Managing late data
- we can allow late data by invoking the `.withAllowedLateness`
	- when we set our PColl's windowing strategy
	- in py, we define it in the `WindowInto`
![[Pasted image 20230605182722.png]]
- the allowed lateness propagates to future PColl derived from `pc`
- we can change the allowed lateness later in our Pipeline
	- we must do so explicitly by applying
		- `Window.configure().withAllowedLateness()`

## adding timestamps to a PColl's elements
- ubs provides ts for each element
- depending on the data source, we have to configure how the ts is extracted from the raw data stream
- we can either specify the timestamp for a BS element-by-element or we can choose to extract from the element, using some logic
	- parsing in most cases
		- ex: log files will contain ts for every log, we can write a DoFn to parse it
			- the parsed ts is attached to each element

## Triggers
- when collecting and grouping data into windows, Beam uses triggers to determine when to emit the aggregated results of each window
	- referred to as a pane
- if we use Beam's default window and trigger config
	- once all data has arrived # how it determines all the data has arrived in BS
		- for UBS when wm moves past the window
	- discards all subsequent data for that window
- we can set triggers for PColls
- diff types of triggers
1. Event time triggers
	- operate on event time, indicated by the ts on each data element
	- beam's default trigger is event-time-based
2. Processing time triggers
	- processing time
	- time when the data element is processed at any given stage in the pipeline
3. data-driven triggers
	- operates by examining data as it arrives in each window
	- fires when the data meets a certain property
	- currently data-driven triggers only support firing after a certain number of data elements
4. Composite triggers
	- combines multiple triggers in various ways

- triggers provide two additional capabilities compared to simply outputting at the end of a window
	- allow to emit early results
		- either based on time or elements
	- allow processing of late data by triggering after the event time wm passes the end of window
- these capabilities allows us to control the flow of our data
- balance b/w diff factors depending on our use case
	- Completeness: how important is it to have all of our data b4 we compute our result
	- latency: how long do we want to wait for ld
	- cost: how much compute/money are we willing to spend
