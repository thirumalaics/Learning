## Metrics
- metrics provide some insight into the current state of a user pipeline
	- potentially while the pipeline is running
- check num of errors during a step
- monitor the number of RPCs made to backend service
- counts of elements that have been processed

### Main concepts of Beam metrics
- **Named**: each metric has a name which consists of a namespace and an actual name
	- the namespace can be used to differentiate b/w multiple metrics with the same name
		- as metrics are step scoped, each step's metric will get a name from the namespace
	 - also allows to query for all metrics within a specific namespace
- **Scoped**: each metric is reported against a specific step in the pp
	- indicating what code was running when the metric was incremented
- **Dynamically created**: metrics may be created during runtime, without pre-declaring them 
- **Degrade Gracefully**- if the runner does not support some part of reporting metrics, the fall back behavior is to drop the metric updates rather than failing the pp
	- if no support, no data returned

- **reported metrics are implicitly scoped to the transform that reported them**
- this allows reporting the same metric name in multiple places and identifying the value each transform reported
	- agging the metrics across the pp
- it is runner dependent whether metrics are accessible during the pipeline execution or only after jobs have completed

## Types of metrics
- three types
- Counter, Distribution, Gauge
- **Counter**: single long value and can be incremented or decremented
- **Distribution**: info about the distribution of reported values
	- value of the element
- **Gauge**: metric that reports the latest value out of the reported values
	- since collected from many workers the value may not be the absolute last, but one of the last values
- within our pipeline itself, we can query metrics matching a given filter
- no python code for all these metrics 

## export metrics
- can be exported to external sinks
- pp configed to push metrics to a sink
	- default 5s period
- only flink and Spark runners support metrics export
