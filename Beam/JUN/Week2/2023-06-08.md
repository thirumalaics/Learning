## Composite trigger
- multiple triggers to form composite triggers
- composite trigger types:
	- we add additional early firings or late firings to `AfterWatermark.pastEndOfWindow`(default) via `.withEarlyFirings` and `.withLateFirings`
	- `Repeatedly.forever` specifies a trigger that executes forever
		- any time the trigger's conditions are met, it causes a window to emit results and then resets and starts over
			- within a window
		- we can combine `Repeatedly.forever` with `orFinally` to specify a condition that causes the repeating trigger to stop
	- `AfterEach.inOrder` combines multiple triggers to fire in specific sequence
		- each time a trigger in the sequence emits a window, the sequence advances to the next trigger
	- `AfterFirst` takes multiple triggers and emits the first time any of its argument triggers is satisfied
		- this is equivalent to logical OR operation for multiple triggers
	- `AfterAll` takes multiple triggers and emits when all of its argument triggers are satisfied
		- this is equivalent to logical AND operation for multiple triggers
	- `orFinally` can serve as a final condition to cause any trigger to fire one final time and never fire again

## Composition with AfterWatermark
- composite trigger can combine with the default firing(wm moves past the window) and either ,or both, of the following:
	- speculative firings that precedes the wm passing the end of the window to allow faster processing of partial results
	- default trigger continues to be in place
	- late firings that happen after the wm passes the end of the window, to allow for handling late-arriving data
- we can express this pattern using `AfterWatermark`
