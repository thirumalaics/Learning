## Provided Windowing Functions
- we can define diff kinds of windows to divide the elements of our PColl
- several windowing fns provided
	- calendar-based-windows
		- not explained below
- we can also define our own WindowFn if we have a complex req
- each ele can logically belong to more than one window
- each element in a PColl can only be in one window
	- if an element is assigned to multiple windows, the element is conceptually duplicated into each of the windows and each element is identical
		- except for its window

## Fixed time windows
- consistent duration
- non overlapping time interval
- ex: all elements with ts 0:00:00 up to but not including 0:00:30 belong to the first window

## Sliding time windows
- overlapping time intervals
- consistent duration
- frequency with which the sliding windows begin is called the period
- useful for running averages of data

- the first argument is duration and the second is period
	- both are in seconds
## Session Windows
- windows that contain elements that are within a certain gap duration of another element
- this windowing applies on a **per-key basis** and is useful for data that is irregularly distributed wrt time
- if data arrives after the min specified gap duration, this initiates the start of a new window

- gap duration 10 mins
- the sessions are per-key
	- each key in the collection will have its own session groupings depending on the data dist
## Single global window
- default window
- can be used with unbounded PColls
- single GW with a default trigger generally requires the entire data set to be available before processing
	- non default trigger for UBS

## Setting our PColl's windowing fn
- can be done by applying the `Window` transform
- when we apply a `Window`, we must provide a `WindowFn`
- also might define trigger
	- determines when each individual window is agged and emitted
	- helps refine how the wfn performs wrt late data and computing early results

## Watermarks and late data
- no guarantee that the data events will appear in our pipeline in the same order that they were generated
- beam tracks a watermark, which the system's notion of when all data in a certain window can be expected to have arrived
	- once the wm progresses past the end of a window, any further element that arrives with a timestamp in the earlier window is considered late data
	- ex: simple wm that assumes approx 30s of lag time bw the event time and the processing time
	- then the beam would close the first window at 5:30
	- if a data record arrives at 5:34 with ts that would put it in 0:00-4:59 window, then the record is late
- precise or complex
- beam's default windowing config tries to determine when all data has arrived(based on the type of data source) and then advances the wm past the end of the window 
	- default config does not allow late data
- triggers are helpful in this case
	- helps determine how to deal with late data
- wm = max ts - lag
