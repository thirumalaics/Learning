## PCollections
- abstraction
- represents a potentially distributed, multi-element data set
- BEAM SOURCE APIs contain addapters to help us read from external sources

## Reading from an external source
- each data source adapters has a Read transform -> to read
	- we must apply that transform to the Pipeline Object itself
	- ex: io.TextFileSource
		- reads from an external text file
		- returns a PCollection
		- element type is String
		- each String represents one line from the text file
```
lines = pipeline | 'ReadMyFile' >> beam.io.ReadFromText('gs://some/inputData.txt')
```

#### [BEAM SYNTAX](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43796046/explain-apache-beam-python-syntax)
- in beam "|" is a synonym for apply, which applies a PTransform to a PCollection
- ">>" allows us to name a step for easier display in various UIs
- the string b/w "|" and ">>" is only used for these display purposes and identifying part of the application

## Creating a PCollection from in-mem data
- use Create transform, to create a PCollection from in mem list
- apply to the Pipeline obj

```
import apache_beam as beam

with beam.Pipeline() as pipeline:
  lines = (
      pipeline
      | beam.Create([
          'To be, or not to be: that is the question: ',
          "Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer ",
          'The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, ',
          'Or to take arms against a sea of troubles, ',
      ]))
```

## PCollection characteristics
- PColl is owned by a specific Pipeline Object
### Element Type
- the elements of a Pcollection may be of any type
- but all must be of the same type
- to support distributed processing, Beam needs to be able to encode each individual element as a byte string #explore 
	- so elements can be passed around to distributed workers
	- Beam SDKs provide a data encoding mechanism that includes built-in encoding for commonly-used types
	-  as well as support for specifying custom encoding as well
## Element Schema
- in many cases, element type has a structure that can be introspected
	- ex: Json, db records
- schemas provide a way to expreses types as a set of named fields

## Immutability
- PColl immutable
- once created cannot add, remove or change individual elements
- beam transform does not consume or modify the original i/p Collection
