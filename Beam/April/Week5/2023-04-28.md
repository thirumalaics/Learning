## Lightweight DoFns and other abstractions  
- if our fn is simple and can be written in one line -> use lambda function  
```  
l = ["w1","w2","w3"]  
words = pipeline|beam.Create(l)  
word_lengths = word|beam.FlatMap(lambda word:[len(word)])  
```  
- the above piece of code functions the same way as the Length example  
- if the ParDo performs one-to-one mapping, for each i/p element there is exactly one o/p element, we can use the higher-level Map transform  
- since in the above case, we do a one to one mapping map fn can be used  
```  
word_lengths = words|beam.Map(len)  
```  
- one thing I noticed here is that both the inline function were used as fns and not expressed inside a subclass of DoFn  
- no use of parDo here at all  
  
## DoFn lifecycle  
- during the execution of the ParDo transform  
- the number of DoFn instances are runner independent  
- same doFn instance might be reused to process more than one bundle on the same worker  
- for each bundle, the startBundle is called at the start of the processing and finishBundle is called at the end of processing  
- processElement() or process is called for each element  
- after calling finishBundle, if DoFn is no more needed, tearDown method is called  
- call of tearDown is done on a best effort basis and thus is not guaranteed

## GroupByKey  
- transform for processing collections of key/value pairs  
- parallel reduction operation  
- analogous to the Shuffle phase of Map/Shuffle/Reduce-style algorithm  
- the i/p is coll of key/value pais that represents a multimap  
- multimap means that more than one value can be associated with a given key  
- keys are repeated  
- multiple keys to individual values  
- GBK used to collect all values for each key  
- o/p might look like:  
```  
key1, [val1,val2,..]  
key2, [val1,val2,..]  
```  
- GBK to transform from multimap to uni-map(unique keys to collections of values)  
- `GroupBy` is the alias for GBK in py  
- only basics of groupy was noted in this topic for now  
  
```  
words_and_line_nums = ...  
grouped_words = words_and_line_nums|beam.GroupByKey()  
```
