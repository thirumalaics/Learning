## Random Access
- Pcollection does not support random access to individual elements
- beam transforms consider every element in a PCollection individually

## Size and boundedness
- PCollection is a large, immutable bag of elements
- there is no upper limit on how many elements a PCollection can contain
- any given PCollection might fit in memory on a single machine
- it might also represent a very large distributed data set backed by a persistent data store
- a PColl can be either bounded or unbounded in size
- whether a PCollection is bounded or unbounded depends on the source of the data set that it represents
	- when reading from a streaming data source such as Pub/Sub or Kafka, we can explicity specify not to consider the Pcoll to be an unbounded Pcoll
- the bounded or unbounded nature of our PColl affects how Beam processes our data
- Beam uses windowing to divide a continuously updating unbounded Pcollection into logical windows of finite size
- these logical windows are determined by some characteristic associated with a data element, such as a timestamp
- agg transforms(such as GroupByKey and Combine) work on a per-window basis

## Element timestamps
- each element in a Pcoll has an associated intrinsic timestamp
- time stamp for each element is assigned by the Source that creates the PColl
- Sources that create an unbounded Pcoll often assign each new element a timestamp that correponds to when the element was read or added
- sources(fixed data source) that create a bounded Pcoll also automatically assign timestamps to elements
	- the most common behavior is to assign every element the same TS(Long.MIN_VALUE)
- We can manually add TSs to the elements of a PColl if the source doesn't do it
	- beam has built in transforms which can do only this

## Transforms
### Applying transforms
- to invoke a transform, we must apply it to the i/p PColl
- Each transform in the BeamSDK has a generic apply method(or pipe operator)
```
[Output PCollection] = [Input PCollection] | [Transform]

[Final Output PCollection] = ([Initial Input PCollection] | [First Transform]
              | [Second Transform]
              | [Third Transform])
```
- Pcoll immutability allows the DAG to branch out
	- we can create multiple new PColls from one i/p PColl

```
[PCollection of database table rows] = [Database Table Reader] | [Read Transform]
[PCollection of 'A' names] = [PCollection of database table rows] | [Transform A]
[PCollection of 'B' names] = [PCollection of database table rows] | [Transform B]
```

- we can build our own composite transforms that nest multiple transforms inside a single larger transform
	- composite transforms are particularly useful for building a reusable sequence of transforms
