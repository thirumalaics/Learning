## GroupByKey and unbounded PCollections
- when using unbounded PColl(UPC), we must use either non-global windowing or an aggregation trigger in order to perform a GBK or CGBK
- GBK or CGBK usually wait for all the data with a certain key to be collected
	- with UPC, data is unlimited
- windowing and/or triggers allow grouping to operate on logical, finite bundles of data
- if we apply GBK or CBK to UPC without setting a non-global windowing strategy, or a trigger strategy, or both for each collection, this will cause IllegalStateException to be thrown
	- this will be at pipeline construction time
- when using GBK or CGBK to group Pcolls that have a windowing strat applied, all of the Pcolls we want to group must use the same windowing strategy
	- again the IllegalStateException is thrown if Pcolls with incompatible windows are involved in GBK or CGBK

## CGBK
- performs a relational join of two or more key/value PColls
	- key type should be same across Pcolls
- For UPC, we must use either non-global windowing or agg trigger
- CGBK accepts a dict of keyed PColls as i/p
- single Pcoll as o/p
	- one key value tuple for each key in the i/p PColls
	- each key's value is a dict that maps each tag(col name like: email, Phno) to an iterable of values
		- the iterable contains values a col's value for one group
```
email_list = [('name1','email1'),...]
phones_list = [('name1','ph1'),...]
phones = p| 'CreatePhones' >> beam.Create(phones_list)
emails = p| 'CreatePhones' >> beam.Create(email_list)
results = ({'emails':emails,'phones':phones} | beam.CoGroupByKey())
```
- the only confusion is how beam found out the column names emails and phones
	- what will be the situation if both of the Pcolls have diff nums of columns #explore

## Combine
- for combining collections of elements or values in our data
- Combine has variants that work on entire PColls
	- some variants that combine the values for each key in the PColls of key/value pairs
- when we apply a Combine transform, we must provide a fn that has the logic for combining the elements or values
- the combining function should be commutative and associative
	- because the fn is not for sure invoked only once on all values with a given key
- i/p data and the value collection may be distributed across workers
- the BSDK also provides some pre built combine fns
	- ex: sum, min, max
- we can write our own combine logic by creating a subclass of CombineFn that has an accumulation type disticnt from the i/p/o/p type
