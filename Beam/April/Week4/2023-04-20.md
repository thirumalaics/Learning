## Basics of beam model
- Pipeline: user-constructed graph of transformations that defines the desired data processing operations
- PCollection: a data-set or data stream. The data that a pipeline processes is part of a PCollection
- PTransform: represents data processing operation, or a step in our pipeline
	- a transform is applied to zero or more PCollection objects and produces zero or more Pcollection(s)
- Schema: a language-independent type definition for a PCollection.
	- the schema defines elements of a Pcollection as an ordered list of named fields
- Runner: component that runs a Beam pipeline using the capabilities of our chosen data processing engine
- SDK: **language specific library** that lets pipeline authors build transforms, construct their pipelines, and submit them to the runner


## Pipeline
- beam pipeline is a graph
	- DAG of all the data and computations
		- this includes reading, transforming and writing the data
- a beam driver program typically starts by creating a pipeline object
	- using this pipeline object we create pipeline's data sets and its transforms

## PCollection
- unordered bag of elements
- potentially distributed, homogeneous data set or stream -> #explore
- owned by the specific pipeline object for which it is created
- multiple pipelines cannot share a PCollection
- The runner is responsible for storing these elements
- usually contains big data
	- too much data to fit in memory on a single machine
- elements of Pcollection cannot be processed individually
	- processed uniformly in parallel
- can be of two types:
	- bounded
		- known, fixed size
		- processed by batch pipelines
	- unbounded
		- dataset grows over time
			- elements are proccessed as they arrive
		- processed by streaming pipelines
- bounded and unbounded Pcollections can co exist in the same pipeline
	- depends on runner
- if runner can only support bounded -> dont use unbounded pcolls
- Every element in a Pcollection has a timestamp associated with it
- when we execute a primitive connector to a storage system, the connector is responsible for providing initial timestamps
	- for batch these timestamps will be negative infinity
- every PColl has a coder
	- specification of the binary format of the elements
	- Beam model operates principally on encoded data
	- Each Pcollection has a declared encoding for its elements called a coder
		- a coder an have multiple sub coders
		- a coder for lists might contain a subcoder for the elements of the list
