**following codes are in Java**
## Join
- beam supports equi-joins on schema PColls
- the following is an example of natural join
	- one in which the same field names are used on both the left-hand and right-hand sides of the join

- each resulting row contains one txn and one review that matched the join condn
- if the fields that are supposed to be matched on both sides have diff names, the following syntax is used

### Complex joins
- most joins tend to be binary joins
	- joining two inputs together
	- sometimes we have more than two input streams that all need to be joined on a common key
	- CoGroup transform allows joining multiple PColls together based on equality of schema fields
	- each PColl can be marked as required or optional in the **final join record**
		- simulating outer joins in multiple sources join #notunderstood 
	- the o/p can optionally be expanded
		- providing individual joined records, as in the join transform
	- the o/p can also be processed in unexpanded format
		- providing the join key along with iterables of all records from each input that matched that key
### Filtering events
- predicate is an expression that evaluates to True, False or Unknown
- can be configured with a set of predicates
	- each one based on specific fields
- only records for which all predicates return True will pass the filter

#### Adding fields to a schema
- AddFields transform can be used to extend a schema with new fields
	- input rows will be extended to new schema by inserting null values for the new fields
	- we can also specify alternate default values
	- if the default null value is used, then the new field type will be marked as nullable
- Nested subfields can be added using the field selection syntax for the same
	- including fields inside arrays or map values
- the operation results in a PColl with expanded schema

#### Removing fields from a schema
- DropFields allows specific fields to be dropped from a schema
- nested fields can also be dropped using the field selection syntax
