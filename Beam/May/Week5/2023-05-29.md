## Schema transforms
- beam provides a coll of transforms that operate natively on schemas
- very expressive
	- allowing selections and aggs in terms of named schema fields
### Selecting input
- often computation is only interested in a subset of the fields in an input PColl
- `Select` transform allows one to easily project out only the fields of interest
- resulting PColl has a schema containing **each selected field as a top-level field**
- following codes are in java

- the nested fields of shippingAddress appear in the top-level
	- and not as nested
- for arrays with element type row, selected field appears separately as a top-level field in the resulting row
	- this means if multiple fields are selected from the same nested row, each selected field will appear as its own array field

- wildcard selections are equivalent to separately selecting each field
	- selecting fields inside of maps have the same semantics as arrays
	- if we select multiple fields from a map individually, then each selected field will be expanded to its own map at the top level
	- set of map keys will be copied, once for each selected field
- sometimes different nested rows will have fields with the same name
	- selecting multiple of these would result in a name conflict
	- `Select.withFieldNameAs` builder method can be used to provide an alternate name for the selected field
- another use of the Select transform is to flatten a nested schema into a single flat schema

#### Grouping agg
- GroupBy transform allows simply grouping data by any num of fields in the i/p schema
	- applying aggs to those groupings and storing the result of those aggs in a new schema field
	- GroupBy transform has a schema with one field corresponding to each agg performed
- simplest usage of GroupBy specifies no agg
	- all the i/ps matching the provided set of fields are grouped together into an ITERABLE field

- key field contains the grouping key
- the names of the key and values fields in the o/p schema can be controlled using this withKeyField and withValueField builders
- common to apply one or more aggs to the grouped result
	- each agg can specify one or more fields to agg, an agg fn and the name of the resulting field
	- the following code is in Python
