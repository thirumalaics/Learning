## Using Schema transforms
- a schema on a PColl enables a rich variety of relational transforms
	- having named fields allow us to express aggs and transforms similar to SQL
### field selection syntax
- adv of schemas
	- allow referencing element fields by name
- beam provides field referencing syntax
	- including nested and repeated fields
	- this syntax is used by all of the **schema transforms** when referencing the fields they operate on
	- the syntax can also be used inside a DoFn to specify which schema fields to process
	- addressing fields by name still retains type safety
		- Beam will check that schemas match at the time the pipeline graph is constructed
		-  the pipeline will fail to launch in the following scenarios:
			- if a field specified does not exist in the schema
			- if a field is specified with type that does not match the type of the field in the schema
		- following chars are not allowed in the field names: `.*[]{}`
- top-level fields can be referenced just by the name of the field

- for now no support in py for nested fields, arrays field and map field selection
	- in java: 
		- nested fields can be referenced using the `.` operator
		- ![[Pasted image 20230528102516.png]]
		- lhs of the . is the containing field
		- rhs of the . is the subfield
		- the `*` operator can be specified at any level to represent all fields at that level

		- an array field, where the array element type is a row, we can reference the subfields
			- when selected, the result is an array of the selected subfield type
				- in the following, the result is array of strings
			- ![[Pasted image 20230528102733.png]]
			- the \[\] can be omitted
			- in the future array slicing will be supported
		- for a map field, the value can be of type row
			- these subfields can be referenced
			- when selected, the result is a map where keys are same as original
				- value will be what we specify
			- similar to arrays, we use {} in the selector to indicate the field is a map type
				- not mandatory
			- in the future there will be option to select only certain keys
			- ![[Pasted image 20230528110633.png]]
				- will result in a row containing a map field with key-type string and value-type string
				- all keys will be present in the result
