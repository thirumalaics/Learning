## Thread-compatibility
- our fn object should be thread-compatible
- each instance of our fn obj is accessed by a single thread at a time on a worker instance
	- unless we explicitly create our own threads
- BEAM SDKs are not thread-safe
	- if we create our own threads in our user code, we must provide our own synchronization

## Idempotence
- fn should be repeatable or retriable as often as necessary w/o causing unintended side effects
- keeping our fn obj idempotent, keeps our pp's o/p deterministic
	- more predictable and hence easier to debug
- non idempotent fns are supported but no guarantee from beam on how many num of times the fn will be called

## Side i/ps
- additional i/ps(other than the main PColl) to a ParDo transform are given in the form of side i/ps
- additional i/p that our DoFn can access each time it processes an element in the i/p Pcoll
- when we provide a side i/p
	- we create a view of some other data that can be read from within the ParDo transform's DoFn -> what does can be read mean?
- especially helpful if the additional data needs to be determined at runtime
- such values might depend on i/p data or diff branch of our PP
