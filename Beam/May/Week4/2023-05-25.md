## Schemas for programming language types
- schemas themselves are language independent
	- they are designed to embed naturally into the prog languages of the Beam SDK being used
	- this allows beam users to continue using native types 
		- while reaping the advantage of having beam understand their element schemas
- in py, we can use the following set of classes to represent schema:
	- Beam will automatically infer the correct schema based on the members of the class:

## schema def
- ordered list of named fields
- each field has a name, a type and possibly a set of user options
	- types can be primitive or composite
- currently supported primitive types

- a field can also reference a nested schema
	- in this case, field type is ROW
	- the nested schema will be an **attr** of this ROW
- three collection types are supported as field types:
	- ARRAY
		- repeated value type
		- repeated elements can have any supported type
		- arrays of nested rows are supported
		- arrays of arrays are supported
	- ITERABLE
		- very similar to array
		- represents a repeated value
		- but one in which the full list of items is not known until iterated over
	- MAP
		- associative map from keys to values
		- all schema types are supported for both keys and values
			- including map
		- values that contain map types cannot be used as keys in any grouping operation

## Logical types
- users can extend the schema type sys to add custom logical types that can be used as a field
- a logical type is defined by a unique identifier and an argument
- a LT also specifies an underlying schema type to be used for storage
	- along with conversions to and from that type
- ex: logical union(OR) can always be represented as a row with nullable fields
	- where the user ensures that only one of those fields is ever set at a time
- the OneOf logical type provides a value class that makes it easier to manage the type as a union
	- while still using a row with nullable fields as its underlying storage
- each logical type also has a unique identifiers
	- so they can be interpreted by other languages as well
