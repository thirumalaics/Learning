- side i/ps are available as an extra arg in DoFn's process method or Map/FlatMap's callable
- when defining the callable, it can have default, keyword, positional args

## Side i/p and Windowing
- a widowed PColl may be indefinite
	- cannot be compressed into a single value
		- or single collection class
- when we create a PCollection view of a windowed Pcoll, the PCollView represents a single entity per window(one singleton per window, one list per window)
- beam uses window(s) for the main i/p element to look up appropriate window for the side i/p element
- beam projects main i/p element's window into the side i/p window set
	- and then uses the side i/p from the result window
	- if both i/p's have identical windows, the projection provides exact corresponding window
	- otherwise projection is used
	- main i/p's window takes precedence
- in sliding window, one element can be part of more than one window
	- each time projection happens and the side i/p returned might be diff
- if the SI has multiple trigger firings, Beam uses the value from the latest trigger firing
	- useful if we use a SI with a single global window and specify a trigger
