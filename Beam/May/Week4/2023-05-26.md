## Defining a logical type
- to define, specify the Schema type to be used to represent the underlying type 
	- as well as unique identifier for that type
- logical type imposes additional semantics on top of schema type
- ex: logical type to represent nanosecond ts
	- represented as schema containing an an INT64 and an INT32 field
	- this schema alone does not say anything about how to interpret this type
	- logical type specifies that the INT64 field represents seconds and the INT32 field represents nanoseconds together
- logical types are also specified by an argument #explore
	- which allows creating a class of related types
	- ex: a limited-precision decimal type would have an integer argument indicating how many digits of precision are represented
		- the argument is represented by a schema type
			- so can itself be a complex type
	- i think this argument is like an option in bash commands
		- modifies the created type
- logical types mostly in JAVA
	- not yet for py

## Creating Schemas
- in order to take advantage of schemas, our PColls must have a schema attached to it
	- often the source itself will attach a schema to the PColl
	- ex: when using AvroIO to read Avro files, the source(AvroIO) can automatically infer a beam schema from the Avro schema and attach that to the PCOLL
	- however not all sources produce schemas

## Inferring Schemas
- beam has a few diff mech for inferring schemas from py code
### NamedTuple
- class in py
- wraps tuple class
	- assigning a name to each element and restricting it to a particular type
	- beam will automatically infer the schema for PColls with NamedTuple o/p types

### beam.Row and select
- methods for ad-hoc schema declarations
	- attaches a schema to the input_pc

- use **select** for more concise expression

- the above declarations do not include any specific info about the types
	- beam will try to infer
	- if not able to, it will fall back to Generic type `Any`
		- not ideal
	- we can use casts to make sure Beam correctly infers types with beam.Row or with Select
