- timer and state: user defined Timer and State params can be used in a stateful **DoFn**

## Composite Transforms
- transforms can have a nested structure
	- a complex transform performs multiple simpler or composite transforms
- makes our code more modular
- beam comes with some built-in composite transforms

### Example composite transform
![[Pasted image 20230523155948.png]]
- the above is an example of CT
- `CountWords` is a `PTransform` subclass that consists of multiple nested transforms

### Creating a composite transform
- to create our own composite transform
	1. create a subclass of the `beam.PTransform`  
	2. override the `expand` method to specify the actual processing logic
- we can then use this transform just as we would use a built-in transform from the BSDK
![[Pasted image 20230523160623.png]]
- our override of expand must accept the appropriate type of i/p PColl as a param, and specify the o/p PColl as the return value
- we can accept more than one PColl and return more than one PColl
- the method can contain
	- BSDK fns
	- other composite transforms
	- core transforms
- our composite transform's params and return value must match the initial i/p type and final return type for the entire transform #explore 
	- even if the transform's intermediate data changes type multiple times
- the expand method of a PTransform is not meant to be invoked directly by the user of a transform
	- we should be calling the apply method on the PColl itself, with the transform as an arg
	- this allows the transform to be nested within the structure of our pp
- Refer PTransform style guide for further tips and info

## Pipeline I/O
- read and write transforms for a number of common data storage types are given by beam
	- we can also implement our own read and write transforms

### Reading i/p data
- returns a PColl
- can be used at any point in our pp

## Writing o/p data
- can be used at any point in our pp
