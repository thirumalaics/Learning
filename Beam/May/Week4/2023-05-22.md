## Additional O/Ps
- ParDo always produces a main o/p PColl(as the return value from apply)
	- we can also have our ParDo produce any num of additional o/p PColls
	- if we choose to have multiple o/ps, our parDo returns all of the o/p PColls(including the main o/p) bundled together
- to emit elements to multiple o/p PColls, invoke `with_outputs()` on the ParDo and specify the expected tags for the o/p
	- `with_outputs()` returns a `DoOutputsTuple` object
	- the tags specified in `with_outputs` are attrs on the returned DoOutputsTuple Object
	- each tag give access to the corresponding O/P PColls

- the result is also an iterable, ordered in the same order that the tags were parsed

## Emitting to multiple o/ps in our DoFn
- inside our ParDo's DoFn, we can emit an element to a specific o/p by wrapping the value and the o/p tag together
	- we use a class TaggedOutput to associate a tag and value
	- looks like tagged output and with_outputs are supposed to be used together for multiple o/ps
	- tagged o/ps can be used with DoFn subclasses and Map, FlatMap's callables

## Accessing additional parameters in our DoFn
- in addition to the element, Beam will populate other params to our DoFn's process method
- any combination of these params can be added to our process method in any order
	- there was a similar concept in Airflow for Python callable of python operator
	- `timestamp`: to access the timestamp of an i/p element, default to `DoFn.TimestampParam`
	 ![[Pasted image 20230522154231.png]]
	- `window`: to access the window an i/p element falls into, default to `beam.DoFn.WindowParam`
		- if an element falls in multiple windows, then the process method will be invoked multiple times
	- `PaneInfo`: when triggers are used, Beam provides a `DoFn.PaneInfoParam` object that contains info about the current firing
		- using the above param, we can determine whether this is an early or late firing
			- how many times this window has already fired for this key
