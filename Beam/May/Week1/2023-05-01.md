- the associativity and commutativity of a CombineFn allows runners to automatially apply some optimizations
	- Combiner lifting
		- most significant optimization
		- i/p elements are **combined** per key and window b4 they are shuffled
			- so the volume of data shuffled might be reduced by many orders of magnitude
		- aka mapper-side combine
	- Incremental Combining
		- when we have a CombineFn that reduces the data size by a lot, it is useful to combine elements as they emerge from a streaming shuffle
		- this spreads out the cost of doing combines over the time that our streaming computation might be idle
		- incremental combining also reduces the storage of intermediate accumulators

## Simple combinations using simple fns
```
pc = [1, 10, 100, 1000]

def bounded_sum(values, bound=500):
  return min(sum(values), bound)

small_sum = pc | beam.CombineGlobally(bounded_sum)  # [500]
large_sum = pc | beam.CombineGlobally(bounded_sum, bound=5000)  # [1111]
```
## Advanced combinations using CombineFn
- for more adv, define a subclass of CombineFn
- we should use a CombinFn if the combine fn requires any or many of the below:
	1. a more sopphisticated accumulator 
	2. must perform additional pre- or post processing
	3. might change the o/p type
	4. takes the key into account
- a general combine functionality consists of four operations
- when we are subclassing CombineFn, we must provide four operations by overriding the corresponding methods:
	1. Create Accumulator: 
		- creates a new local accumulator
		- ex: avg
		- the local accumulator tracks the running sum of values(numerator value)
		- tracks the num of values summed so far(the denominator)
		- it may be called any num of times in a distributed fashion
	2. Add input:
		- adds i/p element to an acc
		- returns the accumulator value
		- in avg example, it would update the sum and count
		- may be invoked in parallel
	3. Merge accumulators
		- merges several accumulators
		- this is how data in multiple accumulators is combined b4 the final calculation
		- in the mean example, the accumulators representing each portion of the division are merged together
		- it may be called again on its o/ps any number of times
	4. extract ouput
		- performs the final computation
		- in mean ex, this is where the final division happens
		- it is called once on the final, merged accumulator
