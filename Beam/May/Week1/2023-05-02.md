```  
class AverageFn(beam.CombineFn):  
def create_accumulator(self):  
return (0.0,0) # returns the start values of elements involved in combine  
  
def add_input(self, sum_count, input):  
sum,count = sum_count #sum_count is the value returned by local accumulator  
return sum+input, count+1 # updated value of elements

sums, counts = zip(*accumulators)  
return sum(sums), sum(counts)

## Combining a PColl into a single value  
- use the global combine fn to transform all the elements to a single value  
- the single value is represented by a Pcoll containing one element  
  
```  
average = pc|beam.CombineGlobally(AverageFn()) # can be any combine Fn  
```  
  
## Combine and global windowing  
- if our PColl is using a single global windowing, the default behavior is to return Pcoll containing one element  
- the ele's value comes from the accumulator in combine fn  
- for sum combine fn, returns zero(on empty i/p)  
- to have combine instead return an empty Pcollection if the i/p is empty, we can specify withoutDefaults when we apply our Combine transform  
  
```  
s = pc | beam.CombineGlobally(sum).without_defaults()  
```  
  
## Combine and non-global windowing  
- when using NGW, beam does not provide the default behavior  
- we must specify one of the following options when applying Combine  
- specify .withoutDefaults() where windows that are empty in the i/p PColl will likewise be empty in the o/p PColl  
- asSingletonView, in which o/p is immediately converted to a PCollectionView, which will provide a default val for each empty window when used as a side i/p.  
- this is generally used only when the result is used as a side i/p later in the pp  
  
  
## Combining Values in a Keyed PColl  
- after creating a keyed PColl(by using a GroupByKey), a common pattern is to combine the collection of values associated with each key into a single, merged value  
- the pattern of GBK followed by merging the collection of values is equivalent to Beam's Combine PerKey transform  
- the Combine fn that we pass to Combine PerKey must be an associative reduction fn or a subclass of CombineFn  
  
```  
accuracy = pred_accuracies | beam.CombinePerKey(beam.combiners.MeanCombineFn()) # for each key finds the average  
```  
  
## Flatten  
- is for PColl objs that store the same datatype  
- used to merge multiple PColl objs into a single logical PColl  
  
```  
merged = ((pcoll1,pcoll2,pcoll3) | beam.Flatten())  
```  
  
## Data encoding in merged Pcolls  
- the coder for the o/p PColl is the same as the coder for the first PColl in the i/p PColl list  
- the i/p Pcolls can use diff coders, as long as they all contain the same data type in the chosen language
