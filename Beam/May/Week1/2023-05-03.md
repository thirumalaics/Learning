## Merging Windowed Collections  
- When using Flatten to merge PColl objects that have a windowing strat applied  
	- all of the Pcoll objs in the merge should use a compatible windowing strategy and window sizing
	- ex: all the colls we are merging should use(hypothetically) identical 5-minute fixed windows or 4-minute sliding windows starting every 30 secs  
- IllegalStateException error thrown when incompatible windows are used  
  
## Partition  
- for Pcolls that store the same datatype  
- splits a single Pcoll into a fixed number of smaller collections  
	- based on the partitioning fn that we provide  
		- fn contains logic that determines how to split up elements into resulting partition  
- the number of partitions must be determined at graph construction time  
	- we can, for example, pass the num partitions as a CL arg at runtime  
	- this will be used to build our pipeline graph
- partition num cannot be determined in mid-pipeline(dynamic,ex: based on the data)  
  
```  
def partition_fn(student,numpartitions):  
	return int(get_percentile(student)*num_partitions/100)  
by_decile = pc|beam.Partition(partition_fn,10) # returns a tuple of Pcoll objs
```
  
## Requirements for writing user code for Beam transforms  
- we should remeber the distributed nature of execution  
- there might be many copies of our fn running on a lot of diff machines in parallel
	- those copies fn independently, without communicating or sharing state with any of the other copies
- each copy of our user code might be retried or run multiple times
	- this depends on our Runner and back-end  
- so we should be cautious about including state dependency in our code  
- user code must fulfill at least these requirements:  
	- fn object must be serializable  
	- fn obj must be thread-compatible(Beam SDKs are not thread-safe)  
	- important to make our fn obj idempotent  
		- non-idempotent fns are supported by Beam, better to have idempotent to avoid side effects  
- these requirements apply to subclasses of DoFn, CombineFn, WindowFn(used with window transform)  
## Serializability
- [[serialization]]
- any fn obj we provide to a transform must be fully serializable  
- this is due to the fact that copy of the function needs to be serialized and transmitted to a remote worker in our processing cluster  
- base classes for user code such as DoFn, CombineFn and WindowFn already implement Serializable  
	- our subclass should not add any non-serializable members  
- Some other serializability factors we should keep in mind:  
	- Transient fields in our fn obj are not transmitted to worker instances, because they are not automatically serialized  
	- avoid loading a field with large amount of data before serialization  
	- individual instances of our fn obj cannot share data  
	- mutating a fn obj after it gets applied will have no effect
