## Multiple units of measure facts
- some BP need a fact to be expressed in multiple units of measure in the same row
- when fact table is huge and there is need to store facts in multiple units:
	- store the facts once in the table in an agreed upon unit
	- store the conversion factors b/w units 
- views can be created on this fact table to satisfy each unit requirements
- conversion factors must reside in the same table 
	- makes the calculation and query simple

## Year-to-date facts
- Year-to-date:
	- period starting from 1st jan of the current year till the current date
- BU often request Year-to-date values in a fact table
- diff requirements: year to date at the close of fiscal period, fiscal period start to date
- YTD facts to be calculated in the BI apps and OLAP cubes
- try not to store in the fact table

## Multipass SQL to avoid fact to fact table joins
- BI app should never issue query that joins 2 fact tables using the common FKs present
- impossible to control the cardinality of the answer set of such a join in RDB [[DWH/Kimball/MAR/2023-03-10#join]]
- answers incorrect
- use ![[2023-01-31#drill across]]
## Timespan tracking in fact tables
- three basic fact table grains ![[2023-01-06#^c9be2a]]
- some times we might need to know for which timespan the fact row was effective
- in those special cases, 3 cols:
	- row effective date
	- row expiration date
	- current row indicator
- addresses slowly changing inventory balances
- useful for ![[2023-01-24#Periodic Snapshot Fact tables]]
## Late arriving facts
- fact row is said to be late arriving when
	- the current context provided in the dim table is not valid for the fact row
- happens when the fact table row is delayed
- in this case dims should be searched to find the appropriate context

# Advanced dimensions techniques

## dim to dim table joins
-  dims can contain references to other dims ![[2023-01-30#outrigger dimensions]]
- these relationships can be modeled without outrigger dims
- this relationship gets tricky if the outrigger dim is SCD and especially type 2
- old records in the parent should be updated(expire it)
- new records have to be inserted for new SKs of out trigger dims
- place the keys of the parent dim and outrigger dim in fact table
- relation b/w dims then only can be found in the fact table
