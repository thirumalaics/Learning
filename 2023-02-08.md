## Text Comments dimension
- free form text comments should not be treated as a metric in the fact table
- store separately in a comments dimension
	- or as an attr in dimensions with one row/txn, if there is a comment for each transaction
- have a corresponding FK in the fact

## multiple timezones
- to capture universal standard time
- to capture local time as well
	- for multi timezone application
- dual FK in the affected tables
	- to two dims

## Measure type dims
- when a fact table has a large number of **facts** that are sparsely filled in any individual row
- removes the empty fact columns
- collapses the fact table row 
- measure type dim - > dim which has measurements(the sparsely filled columns are taken out and put in this table)
- useful if all the measurements are similar in some format
- one column to identify what type of measure it is
- one column to to store the measure itself
- not recommended
- [Normalising a Fact Table | Data Warehousing and Data Science (wordpress.com)](https://dwbi1.wordpress.com/2011/02/26/normalising-a-fact-table/)
- useful when the number of facts is extreme

## Step dimensions
- for sequential processes
- normally one row for each step in a process in a ![[2023-01-23#Txn fact tables]]
- to tell where the step fits in the entire process - > step dimensions
- used to show what step number is represented by the current step
- and session related info

## Hot Swappable dimensions:
- used when a fact table is alternatively paired with different copies of the same dimension

## Abstract generic dimensions
- should be avoided in dim models
- ex: there will be a person dimension which store data related to customers, emplyees, vendors because thery are all people, even though each of these type consist of diff attributes
- attributes of each type of the entity differ
- attributes associated with each type often differ
- results in larger dimensions
- data abstraction might be appropriate in oss
- negatively impacts the query performance in DW/BI
	- and legibility

## Audit dimensions
- contains ETL processing metadata
	- when creating a fact table row
- simple audit dim row can contain one or more indicators of the data quality
- other attrs can be:
	- env var describing the version of etl code used to create fact rows
	- etl processing timestamps
