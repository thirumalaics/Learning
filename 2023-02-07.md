## Multivalued dim and bridge tables
- in classical dim schema, a refence to dim from fact has a single value in dim which is consistent with fact table grain
- there are situations where dims are multivalued
	- patient receiving a health care treatment can have multiple diagnoses
- multi valued dims should be attatched to fact using a group dimension key
	- this group dim key points to a bridge table
	- with one row for each simultaneous values

## Time varied multivalue bridge table
- multi valued bridge table may need to be based on scd 2
- in cases where the group might expire, we need time columns to indicate the same
	- customer and bank accounts
	- 1 customer many accounts
		- the customer might close one account but not the other
			- in this case the group expires and a new group might be created without the expired account
	- joint accounts
- querying apps must filter on date/time to get accurate results

## Behaviour tag time series
- majority of text in dwh is descriptive text in dims
- when we cluster entities, we can observe similarities
	- these clusters define what can be called as behaviour tag(especially if active entities are clustered, ex: customers)
	- these might change over time
- these behaviour tags should be stored in the dim for the respective entity
	- target for filters,grouping
- one column for a sequence of behaviour tags

## Behaviour study groups
- complex customer behaviour can be discovered only by iterative analyses
- to store all this data in the BI app so that it can be used while filtering is not efficient and impractical
- store it in a new table called study group with a FK - >related entity's durable key
	- ex: customer FK
- use this table to filter dimension based on the study as there is a FK relation
- multiple study groups can be defined

## Aggregated facts as dim attr
- BU are interested in often constraining dims based on agged performance metrics
	- ex:customers who have spent over an amount for a period of time
- selected agg facts can be placed in dim table
- high etl strain
- low BI query strain
- metrics often provided as banded ranges

## Dynamic value bands
- dynamic value banding report :
	- organized as a series of report row headers
	- these header define a
		- changing
		- varying-sized ranges of a target numeric facts
- ex: a common value banding report in a bank has many rows with labels such as “Balance from 0 to $10”, “Balance from $10.01 to $25,” and so on
- specific row headers defined at query time
- The row definitions can be implemented in a small value banding dimension table that is joined via greater-than/less-than joins to the fact table, or the definitions can exist only in an SQL CASE statement. 
- The value banding dimension approach is probably higher performing, especially in a columnar database, because the CASE statement approach involves an almost unconstrained relation scan of the fact table.
