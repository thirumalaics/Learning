- super key for which no proper subset is a super key = candidate keys
- PK = chosen candidate key
- the PK should be chosen such that its attr values are never, or are very rarely changed
- FK constraint: if attributes A of relation r1 is a FK that point to the PK B of relation r2, on any db instance the value of A for any tuple in r1 must also be the value of B for some tuple in r2
	- Attr set A is called FK from r1, set B is called referenced attribute(s) aka PK
	- r2 = referencing relation of the FKC, r2 = referenced relation
	- in FKC, the referenced attrs must be the PK of the referenced relation
	- in referential-integrity constraints: referenced attrs that do not form the PK of the referenced relation

- from the section relation, there is a time_slot_id attr, we require the values must exist in the time_slot_id attr of the time_slot relation, even though the time_slot_id is not a PK -> referential integrity constraint
- RIC: referenced attr set need not be the PK
- All FKC are a special case of RIC
- no support for RIC in DBMS
- schema diagrams: db schema , along with FK and PK constraints can be depicted
	- schema diagrams != ERD
