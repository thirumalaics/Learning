- SQL-DDL
	- SQL provides a rich DDL that allows one to define tables with data types and integrity constraints
	- what is the diff b/w SQL-DDL and DDL? #doubt
- DML
	- for access and manipulation of data as organized by the appropriate data model
	- type of access: retrieval, insert, delete and mod
	- two types of DML:
		- procedural: specification of what data are needed and how to get those data
		- declarative: what data are needed
	- query: statement requesting the retrieval of information
	- the portion of DML that involves info retrieval(and sometimes mod) is called a query language
		- SQL is a query language
	- levels of abstraction apply to manipulating data
	- at physical level, we must define algo that allow efficient access to data
	- at higher levels, emphasize ease of use
	- the query processor component of the dbs converts DML queries into sequences of action at the physical level of dbs
- SQL-DML
	- SQL query language is declarative
	- always returns single table
- db access from app progs
	- SQL not powerful as other general-purpose prog-langs
		- some computations that are possible using a general-purpose programming language(GPPL) but are not possible using SQL
		- like: i/p from users, output to displays, or communication over the n/w
	- use SQL in combination with GPPL
		- code written in this pattern result in app programs
	- DML statements need to be sent from the host to the db, done by using an API(set of procedures) that can be used to send DML and DDL statements to the db and retrieve results
	- the Open DB Connectivity standard defines APIs for use with C and several other languages 
	- Java DB Connectivity standard defines a corresponding interface for Java
