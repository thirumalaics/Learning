- storage manager implements several data structures as part of the physical system implementation
	- data files: which stores the db itself
	- data dictionary: which stores metadata about the structure of the db, in particular the schema of the db
	- indices: provides fast access to the data
- Query processor components: 
	- DDL interpreter: which interprets DDL statements and records the definitions in the Data Dictionary
	- DML compiler: which translates the DML statements in a query language into a evaluation plan consisting of low-level instructions that the query-evaluation engine understands
		- conflicting with ![[DBMS/AUG/2023-08-16#^77d4f0|2023-08-16]]
		- a query can usually be translated into any of a number of alternative evaluation plans that all give the same result
		- The DML compiler also performs query optimization
			- picks the lowest cost evaluation plan from among the alternatives
	- query evaluation engine: executes low-level instructions generated by the DML compiler
- TXN Management
	- all-or-none requirement is called atomicity
	- it is essential that the execution of fund transfer(ex) preserves the consistency of the db
		- value of sum of balances A and B must be preserved
		- correctness requirement is called consistency
	- post the fund transfer, the new value of balances of accounts must persist, despite the possibility of system failure -> durability
	- txn: is a collection of operations that performs a single logical function in a DBapp
	- if the DB was consistent when a txn started, the db must be consistent when the txn successfully terminates
	- temporary inconsistency is allowed
		- either debit or credit must be done before the other
		- this temp inconsistency may lead to difficulty if a failure occurs
	- ensuring the atomicity and durability properties is the responsibility of the DBS, specifically recovery manager
		- to ensure atomicity, a failed txn must have no effect on the state of the db, db must be restored to the state in which it was before the txn
			- called failure recovery: detect sys failures and restore the db to the state that existed prior
	- responsibility of the concurrency-control manager: control the interaction among the concurrent txns, to ensure the consistency of the db
	- consistency is responsibility of the user
	- txn manager consists of concurrency-control manager and RM
