- there are two modes in which dbs are used
	- is to support OLTP
		- large number of users retrieving small amounts of data, and performing updates
	- is to support data analytics
		- processing of data to arrive at a conclusion and infer rules or decision procedures
		- data mining: process of sorting through large data sets to identify patterns and relationships that can help solve business problems through analysis
## Purpose of DBS
- one way to keep info on a comp is to store it in OS files
- to allow users to manipulate the information, the system has a number of application programs that manipulate files
	- as the need arises new programs are created
	- as time goes by, the sys acquires more files and more application programs
	- this is typical file-processing system
- keeping org info in a file-processing system has a number of major disadv
- data redundancy and inconsistency
	- since diff programmers involved, various data files might have diff structure and programs might be written in diff programming langs
	- same info might be stored in diff places
		- higher data storage and access cost
		- leads to data inconsistency
- difficulty in accessing data
	- writing programs as need arises will not work for ad-hoc data requirements
	- data retrieval is not convenient and efficient
