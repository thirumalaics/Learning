- we require that for all relations r, the domains of all attrs of r be atomic
- domain is atomic if elements of the domain are considered to be indivisible units
	- no complex data types such as arrays which can further be split
- important issue is not what the domain itself is, but rather how we use domain elements in our db
	- ex: ph_no attr stores a single ph num, if we split the value from the attr into country, area code and local number -> treating as non-atomic value
	- if we treat each ph_no as a single indivisible unit, then the attr would have an atomic domain
- the strict structure imposed by relations are suitable for static apps
## DB Schema
- logical design
- db instance: ss of the data in the db at a given instance in time
- concept of relation = variable in programming lang
- relation schema = type definition of the var
- relation schema consists of a list of attrs and their corresponding domains
- relation instance = value of a var
- same name is used to refer both relation instance and  schema
schema = department(dept_name, building, budget)
- no two tuples in a relation are allowed to have exactly same value for all attrs
