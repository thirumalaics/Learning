## DB-Engine
- a db engine is partitioned into modules
	- each module deals with some responsibility
- the functional components of a db sys can be broadly divided into:
	- storage manager, the query processor components, txn management components
- data stored in disks because data stored in mem is lost if sys crashes
	- data moved b/w disk and memory as needed
	- data movement to/from disk is slow relative to the speed of the CPU
		- it is imperative that the dbs structure data so as to minimize the need to move data b/w disk and main mem
	- alt soln: SSD
- query processor helps the dbs to simplify and facilitate access to data
	- provides good performance even for users working at the view level
- txn manager is imp because it allows app developers to treat a sequence of db accesses as if they were a single unit that either happens in entirety or not at all
	- allows dev to think at a high level about the app without being concerned about managing the effects of concurrent access to the data and of system failures
- earlier DBE were centralized computer systems
	- modern DBE focus on parallel data storage and query processing

### Storage Manager
- component of a DBS that provides the interface b/w the low-level data stored in the db and app programs and queries submitted to the sys
- storage manager is responsible for the interaction with the file manager
	- raw data are stored on the disk using the file system provided by the OS
- the storage manager translates the various DMLS into low-level file-system command ^77d4f0
- responsible for storing, retrieving and updating data in the DB
- storage manager components include:
	- authorization and integrity manager: tests for the satisfaction of integrity constraints and checks the authority of users to access data
	- txn manager: ensures that the db remains in a consistent state despite system failures and concurrent txn executions proceed without conflicts
	- file manager: manages the allocation of space on disk and dss used to represent info stored on disk
	- buffer manager: responsible for fetching data from disk storage into main mem, deciding what data to cache in main memory
		- critical comp, enables db to handle data sizes that are much larger than the size of main mem
