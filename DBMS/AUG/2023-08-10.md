## Instances and Schemas
- the collection of information stored in the db at a particular moment is called an instance of the db
- the overall design of the db is called the db schema
- db schema corresponds to a definition
- instance is the db schema filled with data
- db systems have several schemas
	- partitioned according to the levels of abstraction
	- physical schema describes the db design at the physical level
	- logical describes the database design at the logical level
	- a db may also have several schemas at the view level, sometimes called subschemas, that describe different views of the db
	- logical schema has the most effect on app programs
	- physical schema can be changed easily without affecting apps
- traditionally logical schemas were changed infrequently, if at all
## DB langs
- DBS provides a DDL, DML
	- these are parts of a whole DBL
- DDL: to specify db schema
	- also used to specify additional properties of data
	- we specify storage structure and access methods used by the db sys by a set of statements 
		- these statements are written in a special type of DDL called data storage and definition language(DSDL)
		- defines the implementation details of the db schemas
	- provides facilities to specify constraints
		- not all constraints are supported
	- dbs only implements those integrity constraints that can be tested with minimal overhead:
		- domain-c: possible value
		- RI
		- authorization: we may want to differentiate among the users by the type of access they are permitted on various data values in db
			- these differentiations are expressed in terms of **authorization**
			- read, insert, update, delete authorization
			- specific user, all, or groups can be assigned
	- o/p generated when run, o/p stored in the data dict
		- data dict considered to be a special type of table that can be accessed and updated only by the dbs itself
			- data dict consulted before reading or modifying actual data
