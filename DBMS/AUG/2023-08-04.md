- Data isolation
	- since data is scattered, various files and formats
	- hard to program
- integrity problems
	- data values stored in the db must satisfy certain types of consistency constraints
	- adding, modifying constraints via code is complex
		- made worse by different files that are to be dealt with
- atomicity problems
	- if a failure occurs in between an operation, the data should be restored to the consistent state that existed prior to failure
- concurrent-access anomalies
	- concurrent updates to data might leave the data inconsistent
- security problems
	- app programs being added to the file-processing sys in an ad hoc manner makes it complex to enforce security constraints
	- not every user of the dbs needs access to all data
## View of data
- data models
	- underlying structure of a db is the data model
		- dm includes a collection of conceptual tools for describing data, data relationships, data semantics, and consistency constraints
	- can be classified into four diff categories
		- relational model: uses a coll of tables to represent both data and the relationships among those data
			- tables known as relations
			- example of record-based models
				- used to describe the db that is structured in fixed-format records of several types
				- each table contains record of particular type
				- each record type defines a fixed num of fields or attrs
		- ERM: uses collection of basic objects called entities, and relationships among these objects
		- Semi-structured: permits the specification of data where individual data items(record) of same type have diff sets of attrs
		- Object-based: well integrated into relational dbs
			- extension of RM
