- DBMS is a collection of interrelated data and a set of programs to access those data
- the collection of data -> db
- primary goal of DBMS is to provide a way to store and retrieve db info that is both convenient and efficient
- management of data: defining structures for storage of info and providing mechanisms for the manipulation of info + security and safety
- db sys are used to manage collections of data that are highly valuable, relatively large and accessed by multiple users and apps(often at the same time)
- modern dbs exploit commonalities in the structure of data to gain efficiency but also allow for weakly structured data and for data whose formats are highly variable
- so we deal with complex collection of data, key to management of complexity is the concept of abstraction
	- similar to one in programming
	- dbs provides a simpler, abstract view of the info so that users and app programmers do not need to be aware of the underlying details of how data are stored and organized
		- makes it possible for an org to combine data of various types into a unified repo of info needed to run the enterprise
- support for programmer interaction with dbs improved
