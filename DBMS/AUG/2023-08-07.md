## Data abstraction
- for the system to be usable, it must retrieve data efficiently
- the need for efficiency has led DBS developers to use complex data-structures to represent data in the db
	- does complexity bring efficiency
- dev hide the complexity from users through several levels of data abstraction, to simplify interactions with the system
	- physical level: lowest-level, describing how the data are actually stored, including the data structures
	- logical: describes what data are stored in the db, and what relationships exist among those data
		- describes the db in terms of a small num of relatively simple structures
		- implementation of structures at the logical level may involve complex physical-level structures, the user of the logical level does not need to be aware of this complexity
			- physical data independence
		- DBA deciding what info needs to be stored uses this
		- complexity is present in case of large db
		- many users do not need all the info given by logical level
	- view: only part of the entire db described
		- many views for the same db is possible

- the dbs allows app dev to store and retrieve data easily using the abstractions of the dm 
	- converts the abstract operations into operations on the low-level implementation
- at the physical level, records can be described as a block of consecutive bytes
	- some physical level details: many diff ways to store tables in files, attrs delimited by comma and records delimited by new-line
	- indexes are physical level detail
- at logical level, each record is described by a type definition and interrelationship of the record types is defined
- view level, computer users see a set of app programs that hide details of the data types
