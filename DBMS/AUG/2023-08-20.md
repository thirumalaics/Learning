## DBA
- one of the reasons for DBMS is to have control over both the data and the programs that access those data
	- a person who has such central control over the system is called a DBA
- the functions of a DBA include:
	- schema definition: the DBA creates the original DB schema by executing a set of data definition statements in the DDL
	- storage structure and access-method definition: the DBA may specify some parameters pertaining to the physical organization of the data and the indices to be created
	- schema and physical-organization modification: DBA modifies both to meet changing requirements or to improve performance
	- granting of authorization for data access: to regulate actions of users within the DBenv. the authorization info is kept in a special system structure that the dbs consults whenever a user tries to access the data in the system
	- routine maintenance: 
		- periodically backing up the db onto remote servers, safety from Disasters
		- ensuring availability of disk space for normal operations, and upgrading disk space as required
		- monitoring jobs running on the db and ensuring that the performance is not degraded by very expensive tasks submitted by some users

# CH2: Intro to the relational model
- started out simple and throughout the years added some enhancements
	- ex: object oriented features such as complex data types and stored procedures, support for XML data and various tools to support semi-structured data
- relational model is independent from any specific underlying ds
	- made the RM survive new data storage approaches including modern column-stores
## Structure of Relational DB
- RDB consists of tables
- row in a table represents a relationship among a set of values
	- table is a collection of such relationships
	- table = relation in maths
	- relationship b/w n values is represented mathematically by an n-tuple of values ~ row
- relation instance refers to a specific point-in-time ss of a relation that contains a specific set of rows
	- the following is a relation instance of instructor

- order in which tuples appear in a relation is irrelevant, since a relation is a set of tuples #doubt
- for each attribute of a relation, there is a set of permitted values called the domain of that attr
	- ex: domain of salary attr of the instructor relation is the set of all possible salary values
