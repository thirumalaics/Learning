## DB and App architecture
- arch of a DBS that runs on a centralized server machine:

- the centralized arch shown here is applicable to shared-memory server architectures(has multiple CPU and exploit parallel processing), all the CPUs access a common shared memory
- to scale up to even larger data volumes and even higher processing speeds, parallel dbs are designed to run on a cluster consisting of multiple machines
- further distributed databases, allow data storage and query processing across multiple geographically separated machines
- db-applications can be partitioned into two or three parts

- earlier gen db apps used a two-tier arch, where the application resides at the client machine and invokes db system functionality at the server machine through query language statements
- modern db apps use three-tier arch
	- client machine acts as merely frontend and does not contain any direct db calls
		- ex: web browsers and mobile apps
	- the frontend comms with the application server
	- the app server communicates with the dbs to access data
	- the business logic is embedded in the app server instead of being distributed across multiple clients
		- business logic of the app says what actions to carry out under what conditions
		- PDF PG: 49
	- three tier provides better performance and security
## DB Users and Admins
- people who use db can be categorized as users or administrators
- DBU and UI
	- 4 types of users depending upon the way they expect to interact with the system
	- diff types of UI have been designed for diff types of users
		- naive users: who interact with the system by using predefined UI(web or mobile app)
			- forms(for write) and reports(for read)
		- app programmers can choose from many tools to develop UIs
		- sophisticated users interact with sys without writing programs
			- they form their requests either using db query language or by using tools(analysis s/w)
			- ex: analysts who submit queries
