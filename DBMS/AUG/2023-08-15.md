## DB Design
- DBS are designed to manage large bodies of info
	- these bodies of info do not exist in isolation
		- mostly part of a sys
- involves design of the db schema
- the initial phase of db design, then, is to characterize fully the data needs of the DBUsers
	- DB-designer to interact extensively with domain experts 
	- outcome: spec of user requirements
	- high-level data model: provides a conceptual fw in which to specify the data requirements of the db users and how the db will be structured to fulfill these requirements
- designer chooses a data model, applies concepts of the chosen data model, translates the requirements into a conceptual schema of the DB
	- called conceptual design phase 
	- goal: specify data and their relationship
- if relational model is chosen: the conceptual-design process involves decision on what attrs we want to capture in the db and how to group these attrs to form the various tables
	- 'what' part involves business decision
	- 'how' part is a computer-science problem
		- two ways to tackle:
			- use ERM
			- employ set of algos(collectively known as normalization that takes as input the set of all attrs and generates a set of tables)
	- fully developed conceptual schema indicates the functional requirements of the enterprise
		- functional requirements: users describe the kinds of operations(or transactions) that will be performed on the data
			- ex: searching for and retrieving specific data and deleting data
		- review the schema to check if it meets the functional requirements
- the process of moving from an abstract data model to the implementation of the db proceeds in the final two steps
- in logical-design phase, the designer maps the high-level conceptual schema onto the implementation data model of the DBS that will be used
- the designer uses the resulting sys-specific db schema in the subsequent physical-design phase
	- physical features of the dB specified
	- ex: file organization and the internal storage structures
