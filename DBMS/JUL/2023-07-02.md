- PK is the candidate-key chosen to be the unique row identifier
- PK is a Super-key as well as a candidate-key
- if each PK value uniquely identifies a row, the table is said to exhibit entity integrity
- to maintain entity integrity, a null is not permitted in the PK
	- null means no value
	- should be avoided in other attributes too
- nulls, if used improperly, can create probs
	- they have diff meanings: unknown attr value or known, but missing, attr value or not applicable condition
	- problems can be seen in count, avg, sum
- controlled redundancy makes rdb work
- tables within a db share common attrs that enable the tables to be linked together
- if a FK appears more than once in table, it is not treated as redundancy as their presence require to make the relationship to work
- rdb can also be represented by a relational schema
	- textual representation of the db tables where each table is listed by its name followed by a list of its attrs in \(\)
	- the PK attrs are underlined

- the link b/w the tables can be represented using relational diag

- the link in an ERD is equivalent of the rl line in ERD
- if PK of one table appears in another table = FK
- if the FK contains either matching values or nulls, the table that makes use of the FK is said to exhibit referential integrity
- secondary key: key that is used strictly for data retrieval purposes
	- does not necessarily return unique outcome
	- usually something the searcher can remember
- secondary key's effectiveness in narrowing down a search depends on how restrictive the secondary key is
	- how many row can have the same value
