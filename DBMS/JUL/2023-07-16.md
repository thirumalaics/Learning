## Integrity Rules
- integrity rules important to good db design
- many RDBMs enforce integrity rules automatically
- but manual checking is a must

- we can use dummy values in the table that contains a FK
	- ex: -99 if type is int
	- there should be a row with PK -99 in the the parent table
	- then only the referential integrity holds
	- dummy row
- other integrity rules that can be enforced in the RM are NOT NULL and UNIQUE constraints

## Relational Set Operators
- relational algebra defines the theoretical way of manipulating table contents using the eight relational operators:
	- SELECT, PROJECT, JOIN, INTERSECT, UNION, DIFFERENCE, PRODUCT and DIVIDE
- degree of relational completeness: extent to which relational algebra is supported
	- very few DBMSs are capable of supporting all eight relational operators
- relational operators have the property of closure
	- use of relational algebra operators on existing relations(tables) produces new relations
1. SELECT: aka RESTRICT, yields values for all rows found in a table that satisfy a given condition
	- can be used to list all rows
	- yields a horizontal subset of a table
2. PROJECT: yields all values for selected attrs
	- yields vertical subset
3. UNION: combines all rows from two tables, excluding duplicate rows
	- tables must have the same attr chars(the cols and domains must be compatible)
		- if so, then they are said to be union-compatible
4. INTERSECT: rows that appear in both tables
	- should be intersect compatible
5. DIFFERENCE: all rows in one table that are not found in the other table
	- subtracts one table from the other
	- should be difference-compatible
	- subtracting table1 with table2 is not the same as it's inverse
6. PRODUCT: yields all possible pairs of rows from two tables: cartesian product

7. JOIN: combine two or more tables
	- allows info to be separate
	- natural join: link tables by selecting only rows with common values in their common attrs
	- three-step process:
		- PRODUCT of the tables is created
		- SELECT is performed on the o/p to yield only rows for which the common attrs' common values condition is met
			- common columns are referred to as the join columns
		- PROJECT is performed on the results to yield single copy of each attr
			- eliminates duplicate cols
	- equijoin, link tables on the basis of an equality condition that compares specified cols of each table
		- outcome does not eliminate duplicate cols
		- condition for join must be explicitly defined
		- if another comparison operator is used, then the join is theta join
