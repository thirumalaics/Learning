- theta, equi and natural joins are classified as inner joins
	- a join that only returns matched records from the table that are being joined
- outer join: matched rows would be retained and any unmatched values in other table would be left null
	- better to think of an outer join as an inner join plus
	- outer join returns all of the matched rows that the inner join does plus it returns unmatched records from one of the tables
 - outer joins are especially used to determine what values in the related tables cause referential integrity problems
	 - these problems are caused when the PK != FK(in the child table)
- DIVIDE: operates on two tables, with a single column(ex: column a) table as the divisor(bottom) and one 2-column table(column a and b) as the dividend(up)
	- o/p: single col with values of column a from the dividend table rows

- common col is code
- to be included in the resulting table, a value in the unshared column(LOC) must be associated with every value in the table with one column
- only value associated with both A and B is 5
## Data dict and the system catalog
- dd: detailed description of all tables found within the created db
	- contains metadata
	- data desc contains at least all of the attr names and characteristics for each table in the sys
	- data dict also contains additional info about relationship types, entity and referential integrity checks and enforcements , and index types and components
	- aka database designer's db
		- because it records the design decisions about the tables and their structures

- system catalog contains metadata
	- detailed system data dict that describes all objects within the db
	- including data about tables names, creator, access privileges etc.. 
	- sys-c and dd used interchangeable
	- current rdbs only provide sc, from which the data dict should be derived
	- is a system-created db whose tables store the user created db characteristics and contents
	- can be queried like any other table
	- allows users to check for and eliminate homonyms(similar sounding words with diff meanings or identically spelled words with diff meanings) and synonyms
	- in db it indicates use of same attr name to label diff attrs in diff tables
		- avoid homonyms
	- synonym: use of diff names to describe the same attr
		- avoid
