## Relationships within the RDB
- 1:M relationship is the relational modeling ideal
	- should be the norm
	- for one row from table on the left there will be many rows from table on the right
	- implemented easily by placing the PK of the 1 side in the table of the many side as the FK
	- any candidate key **must** have the not null and unique constraints enforced
- 1:1 should be rare
	- treated as a special case of 1:M relationship in which the many is restricted to a single occurrence
	- the use of a 1:1 rl ensures that two entity sets are not placed in the same table when they should not be
	- also presence of 1:1 relationship sometimes means that the entity components were not defined properly
	- it could indicate that the two entities actually belong in the same table
	- one place where 1:1 is required: generalization hierarchy
		- discussed later
- M:N cannot be implemented as such in the relational model
	- implemented as two 1:M in Relational env

- M:N contd
	- if two students take 3 classes each
	- the relationship should not be implemented as in the 3.25
		- FKs placed in both sides of the many rl
		- table creates many redundancies
		- redundancies produces chances of anomalies
		- with this structure, relational operations are likely to be complex and lead to system efficiency errors and o/p errors
		- can be solved by creation of composite entity
			- aka bridge entity or associative entity
			- table used to link the tables that were originally related in a M:N relationship
			- consists at least  the two tables' primary key, we use the combination of these FKs as PK for the new table or create a new PK
