## Summary contd
- conceptual models are better suited for high level data modeling
- implementation models are better for managing stored data for implementation
- ERM - > conceptual
- hierarchical and n/w -> implementation
- OODM and RM - > both

## Degrees of Abstraction
- db designer starts with an abstract view of the overall data env
	- adds more details as design comes closer to implementation
- using levels abstractions can help in integrating multiple views of data
	- often which are conflicting
- ANSI defined a FW for data modeling
	- based on the degrees of data abstraction
	- ANSI/SPARC architecture
	- three levels of abstraction defined:
		- external
		- conceptual
		- internal
	- later another level was added : physical
		- to explain physical level implementation details of internal model

## External Model
- end user's view of the data env
- end users: users who use apps to manipulate data to generate info
- these apps usually have a business unit focus
	- departments
- each business units have their own constraints and requirements
	- each one uses a subset of the entire data present in the database
- these end users view of the subset of data seems isolated from the other data in the db
- ER diagrams will be used to represent external views
	- a specific representation of an external - > external schema
- although application views are isolated, each view shares some data with the other external view

- adv of external views
	- gives information about a specific business unit's data
	- can be used to get feedback from the business unit about the model's adequacy
	- since isolated view, security wise this is safe
		- will not affect the entire db
	- app program dev is made much easier
