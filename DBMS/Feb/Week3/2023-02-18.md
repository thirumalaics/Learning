## Newer data models: Object/Relational and XML
- OODM allowed richer representation of complex objects
- this put pressure on RM
	- result is Extended relational data model(ERDM)
- ERDM :
	- adds many of the features of OO to simpler RDB structure
	- new gen of RDB supporting
		- objects(encapsulated data and methods)
		- extensible data types based on classes
		- inheritence
	- DBMS based on ERDM is often described as object/relational database management system(O/R DBMS)
- organizations integrated their business models with internet - > to distribute, access information
- in this situation XML(extensible markup language) became the standard way of representating struc, semi-struct and unstruct data for exchange
- the unstructured data was growing
- XML dbs were created to manage unstructured data within a native XML format
- O/R DBMS added support for XML based docs

## the future of data models
- O/R DBMS is the dominant db
- successful because:
	- conceptual simplicity
	- simple query language
	- high transaction performance
	- high availability
	- high security
	- high scalability
- OODBMS famous in :
	- Computer aided drawing
	- computer aided manufacturing
	- geographic information sys
	- telecommunications and multimedia
- OODM created to satisfy very specific needs
	- not for general data management tasks
- RDM created for better data management
- OO concepts very influential in programming languages
- O/R DBMS very supportive in ever-evolving data management needs
	- suitable for Unstruct as well
- ORDBMS:
	- hybid dbms
		- retain the adv of performance char of RM
		- semantically rich char of OO
## Summary of data models
- some common char that DM should have, to be accepted:
	- show some degree of conceptual simplicity without compromising the semantic completeness of the db
	- represent real world as closely as possible
		- achieved by adding more semantics to the model's data representation
	- representation of the real-world transformations must be in compliance with the consistency and integrity characteristics of any data model
