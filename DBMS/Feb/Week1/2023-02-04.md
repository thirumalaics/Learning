## Data modeling and models
- db design = focuses on how the db structure will be used to store and manage end-user data
- Data modeling first step in database design
	- refers to the proccess of creating a data model for a determined problem domain
- problem domain = clearly defined area within the real-world env
	- with well defined boundaries and scope
- simple representation
	- usually graphical
	- models real-world complex ds
- model = abstraction of more complex real-world object or event
- main func is to make us understand the complexities of real world env.
- within a db env, data model represents data structures and their 
	- characteristics
	- relations
	- constraints
	- transformations
	- and other constructs that serve as part of solution for the problem domain
- data model ~ database model
- database model = implementation of data model in a specifc db sys
- data modeling : iterative and progressive process
- start with a simple understanding of the problem domain
	-  level of detail of data model is then simple and low level
	- as the understanding increases -> level of detail of dm increases
- if done properly -> 
	- final data model will act as a blueprint 
	- contains instructions to build a db
	- db will meet the end user requirements
- blueprint is narrative and graphical in nature
	- precise txt instructions
	- useful diag depicting the main data elements
- implementation ready data model should contain at least the following components:
	- description of data structure that would hold the end user data
	- set of enforcable rules to guarantee the integrity of our data ^f1e63a
	- a data manipulation methodology to support real-world transformations
- a correct data model is one that meets all end user requirements
	- may be more than one data model might be correct

## Importance of data model
- facilitate interaction among designer, the apps programmer, and the user
- a well developed data model can help the understanding the whole org
- communication tool
