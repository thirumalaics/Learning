## data model basic building blocks
1. entities
2. attributes
3. relationships
4. constraints

#### ENTITY
- anything about which data are to be collected and stored
	- ex: person,place, thing, event
- represents particular type of object in the real world
	- because of the above, entities are distinguishable
		- i.e each entity occurence is unique and distinct
- entities can also be abstractions
	- ex: flight routes, musical concerts
- entity names are capitalized as per convention

#### ATTRIBUTES
- are characteristics of an entity
	- ex: CUSTOMER entity's attrs: name, phone addr
- fields or columns

#### RELATIONSHIP
- association b/w entities
	- ex: relationship b/w customer and agent
		- agent can serve many customers
		- customer can be served by an agent
- data models use 3 types of relationships:
	- one to many(1:M or 1..\*) 
	- many to many(M:N(std) or \*..\*, M:M)
	- one to one(1:1 or 1..1)

##### one to many
- painter and his paintings
- painter is one
- but he can draw many paintings
- each painting is painted by a painter
- customer and their invoices
- customer is one
- one customer can generate multiple invoices
- each invoice is created by one customer

##### many to many
- an employee learns many job skills
- a job skill might be learned by many employees
- student can take many classes
- a class can be taken by many students

##### one to one
- each store managed by one emplyee(manager)
- each employee can work in only one store

- relations are bidirectional

#### CONSTRAINT
- restriction placed on the data
- help in maintaining data integrity
- expressed in the form of rules [[2023-02-04#^f1e63a]]
	- student GPA 0 to 10
	- each class must have one an only class advisor

- how to properly identify all the above blocks in a situation?
	- identify the business rules for the problem domain


## Business rules
- when we start to determine the above building blocks
	- we get to know what type of data is used in the org
	- how data is used
	- when it is used
- but the above info is not the same as understanding of business 
- from a db pov, data becomes meaningful only when it conforms to business rules
- business rule: 
	- breif
	- precise
	- unambiguous description of policy/procedure/principle
- business rules apply to any org
	- irrespective of size
	- that stores and uses data
- derived from the description of an org's ops
	- helps to create and enforce actions
- properly writen BR helps to define the four building blocks
- BR must be - so that everyone in the org has the same understanding
	- easy to understand
	- widely shared
- describe the main and distinguishing characteristics of the data as viewed by the org 
	- ex: invoices can be created by only customers
	- delivery can be done only by employees

## Discovering BR:
- main sources of BR:
	- managers
	- policy makers
	- dept managers
	- written doc : company procedure, stds and operations manual
	- direct interview with end users(less reliable)
- identifying BR and documenting them is important:
	- help standardize the the company's view of data
	- communication tool b/w the users and designers
	- allow designer to understand the nature,role and scope of data
	- helps in creating a good data model
- not all BR can be modeled

## Translating BR into Data model components
- BR help in identifying the appropriate DMC
- General rule: a noun in a business rule translates to an entity
- the verbs(active or passive) associating nouns will translate to relationship among the entities
	- ex: customer(noun - > E) generates(verb -> R) many invoices(noun - > E)
	- to properly identify the relationship, consider relationships are dir
		- customer  (A)
		- invoice (B)
		- how many instances of A is associated to one instance of B? 1
		- how many instances of B is associated to one instance of A? M
