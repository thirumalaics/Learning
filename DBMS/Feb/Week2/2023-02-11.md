## Evolution of data models
- several data models were developed to overcome filesys short comings
- these models represent:
	- ideas about what a database is 
	- what it should do
	- the types of structures it should use
	- type of techs it should used to implement these structures

## Hierarchical and Network models

### Hierarchical

^5c8e87

- structure represented by inverted tree
- hierarchical structure contains levels, or segments
- segment = file system's record type
- parent child relationship
- depicts 1:M relationship b/w the parent and children segments
### Network
- represents complex data relationships
	- more effective than hierarchical
- more than one parent allowed
- some important concepts developed during this time are still used
- schema: conceptual organization of entire database as viewed by the ![[2023-01-28#^65dc3b]]
- subschema: defines the portion of database seen by the app which produces the info we need from the data contained within the db
- data management language: 
	- defines the env in which data can be managed
	- to work with data
- schema data definition language: allowed DBA to define the schema components
- too cumbersome
- lack of ad hoc query capability
	- programmers had to be pressurized to write programs to retrieve reports

## Relational model
- based on mathematical concept called relation
- relation(sometimes called as a table) - matrix composed of intersecting rows and columns
- each row in a relation = tuple
- each col represents an attribute
- also defines data manipulation methods based on maths
- Relational data model implemented using RDBMS
- RDBMS fns = N/w and hierachical DBMS fns +  more fns
- main adv of RDBMS: abstracts the complexities of relational model from the user
	- physical details are managed
- RM provides a min level of controlled redundancy
	- unnecessary redundancy eliminated
- relational diagram: representation of rdb's entities, entites's attr and relationship b/w the entities
- relational table stores a collection of related entites
	- no data or structural dependence 
- powerful and flexible lang
- from end user perspective, any sql base RDB involves three comps:
	- UI 
	- set of tables
	- SQL engine
### UI:
- i/f to interact with data
- custom i/fs can be created
### SQL engine
- part of dbms
