## Entity Relationship model
- simplicity of RM
- initially RM was descriptive
- ERM involves graphical representation of entities and their relationships
- ERM slightly different from RM
	- base of ERM is RM
- ER models represented in an entity relationship diagram(ERD)
- ER model based on :
	- entity
		- [[2023-02-05#ENTITY]]
		- represented by a rectangle in ERD
			- aka entity box
		- name of entity in caps, singular
		- when applying ERD to a relational model:
			- an entity is mapped to a relational table
		- each row in the relational table : entity instance or entity occurence in the ER model
		- a collection of like entities = entity set ^661226
			- 3 agents in the AGENT entity set
		- to be accurate ERD depicts ENTITY SET
		- each entity is described by a collection of attrs
	- relationships
		- describe associations among data
		- most relationships describe associations b/w two entities
		- [[2023-02-05#one to many]],[[2023-02-05#many to many]],[[2023-02-05#one to one]]
		- ER model uses the term connectivity to label the relationship types above
		- name of relationship is usually a active or passive verb
- two type of representation of Relationships in ER model
- M:N relationships not appropriate in a RM - later chapter

## Object oriented model
- complex real world problems required models that could represented the real world
- In OODM, data and its relationship is contained in a single structure known as an object
- OODM is basis for OODBMS
- OODM consists of a different way of definition and usage of entities
- like relational model's entity, an object is described by its factual content
- unlike RM's entity, an object consists 
	- info about the relationships b/w the facts within the object
	- info about the facts's relationships with other objects
	- therefore facts within the object are given greater meaning
- The OODM is said to be semantic data model because semantic indicates meaning
- object contains all operations that can be performed on it
	- changing data values
	- finding a specific data value
	- printing data values
- Because objects includes
	- data
	- relationships
	- operations
	- makes it self contained and a basic building block for autonomous structures
- components of OODM:
	- object:
		- abstraction of real world entity
		- represents only one occurrence of the entity
	- attributes
		- describe the properties of an object
			- name, age etc..
	- class
		- objects that share similar characteristics are grouped in classes
		- collection of similar objects with shared structure(attr) and behaviour(methods)
		- a class resembles ER model's entity set![[#^661226]]
		- a class method represents a real world actions
			- ex: finding a person name or any attr
			- changing a person name or any attr
			- printing a person name or any attr
		- methods are equivalent procedures in programming langs
		- in OO terms :  behaviour
	- class hierarchy
		- classes are arranged
		- represented by upside down tree
		- each class has only one parent
		- Customer and Employee classes have Person class as parent
		- similarity to [[2023-02-11#^5c8e87]]
	- inheritance
		- ability of an object within the class hierachy to inherit attr and methods of the classes above it
		- customer and emp class inheriting all attr and methods from person
- OODM is typically depicted with Unified Modeling language class diag
- UML = lang that describes the diag, symbols that can be used to graphically to represent an OODM, based on OO concepts

- in object repr - > 
	- INVOICE represents all related objects within the same object box
	- connectivities 1 and M represent invoice's relationship with the other objects
	- one near customer means one invoice to one customer
	- M near Line means one invoice to many line items
- UML diag uses 3 diff classes and two relationships
