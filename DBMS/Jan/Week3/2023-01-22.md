## Data redundancy:
- the file system structure makes it difficult to combie data from multiple sources
- lack of security leaves the system vulnerable
- in computerized file system, the DP specialist might share access to file through programs
- with spreadsheets, users might create their own copy
- when data is scattered or scattered, the possibility of it being updated is less
	- so inconsistency arises
- data redundancy also causes
	- poor data security. 
		- will not be centralized
		- might have to secure all the files that have access
	- data inconsistency
- data that is inconsistent is known to lack integrity

### data integrity 
- state when data in the db are consistent with real-world events and conditions
	- data are accurate
	- data are verifiable
		- data will always yield consistent result
- data entry errors can also cause data integrity problems

### data anamoly:
- is when not all of the required changes in the redundant data are made successfully
- there are different anamolies:
	- update - when field(s) are supposed to be updated in redundant data and this happens only in some records
	- insertion - when inserting a record is not possible due to other constraints 
	- deletion - when deletion of a record will cause undesirable effects

- the use of personal dbs(spreadsheets and desktop db) requires the user to have knowledge of design and data modeling
- data modeling - common method of documenting db designs
- data models gives a clear picture to everyone use the data
	- especially when modifying
- there are standardized data modeling tech 

## DB sys:
- contains strongly related data stored in single logical repository
	- logical - to the end user, appears to be a single unit
	- physically might be distributed(location and h/w wise)
- current gen DBMS s/w stores DS and relationships b/w them, access paths to those structures
	- access paths are defined,stored, managed by dbms
- DB sys's heart DBMS
