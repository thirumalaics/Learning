## File System Redux: Modern End-User Productivity Tools

- user's requirement of hands on access to data helped in adopting PC for business use
- Microsoft Excel became popular
- spreadsheets are not a substitute for a db 
	- this is one of the common misuses of spreadsheets
	- each user started making separate copies of the data - > redundant data 
	- organized data files

## Problems with File system Data processing
- file system is improvement over manual system
- Following are the problems associated with File systems(created by DP specialist and Created with Spreadsheets):
	- lengthy development time: 
		- even the simplest data retrieval task takes extensive programming
		- we should specify what to do and how to do
	- difficulty of getting quick answers
		- need to write programs causes delay in generating reports
	- complex sys administration
		- becomes complex as number of files increase
		- every file needs it's own file management program(add modify delete records etc.)
		- made much worse because of the need of every department to have it's own data
	- lack of security and limited data sharing
		- sharing data among many people introduces security risks
		- spreadsheets provide basic security options
		- but not enough
		- while building file management program - security and data sharing features are difficult to program - often omitted
		- such features include 
			- password protection
			- ability to lock out certain parts of file and systems
			- access control
	- extensive programming
		- making changes to existing file structure is difficult
		- even to change one field, the program does:
			1. read a record
			2. transform original data to conform to the new structure
			3. writes the transformed data to new file
			4. repeat step 1 & 2 for every file
		- change to one file means changes are needed in every program that uses the data in the file
		- these issues lead to the problem of structural and data dependence
- modern dbs use a non procedural data manipulation language
	- only what must be done 
## Structural and data dependence
- file system exhibits structural dependence
	- access to a file is dependent on its structure
	- meaning any change to the structure will affect all the programs that use the data
- changes to data's characteristics also requires all the programs to be modified
	- this is data dependence
