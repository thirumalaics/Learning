- dbms receives all app requests and translates them into complex operations required to fulfill the request

### Advantages:
- dbms allows sharing of data b/w users and apps
- improved data security
	- the more users access the data, the greater the risk
	- dbms provides a FW for better enforcement of data privacy and security policies
- better data integration
	- one single spot to access enterprise wide data
- minimized data inconsistency
	- if the db is properly designed
- improved decision making
	- by product of well managed data and wider data access
	- dbms provides fw to facilitate [[data quality]] initiatives

## Types of databases

- a dbms can support many different types of databases
- db can be classified based on :
	- number of users
	- the db location
	- extent of use
#### number of users:
- based on this we can classify dbs as, either:
	1. single user
	2. multi user
- single user db supports only one user **at a time**
- a single user db running on a pc can be classified as desktop db
- when a multiuser db is used by people <50 or within a department: work group db
- when used by an entire org and many departments: enterprise db
#### location:
-  when a db support the data stored in a single location - > centralised db
- when a db supports data stored across locations - > [[distributed db]]
- there is an extent to which db can be distributed
