## Why Databases?

- ultimate purpose of all business information systems is to help business use information as an organizational resource
- the core of these systems are 
	- collection
	- storage
	- aggregation
	- manipulation
	- spreading
	- management
of data
- storing and managing data is not the end, quickly being able to find a fact in the data is very important
- **Databases** are specialized structures that allow computer based systems to store, manage and retrieve data quickly.

## Data v Information:

- Data: *raw* facts
- raw means that facts have not yet been processed to reveal their true meaning
- Information - *processed* data
- processing  can be as simple as organizing data to reveal patterns or as complex as making forecast.
- to reveal meaning, information requires context.
	- ex: if we are talking about some average temperature, it would make more sense if we know:
		- Celcius or Farhenheit
		- is it the temperature body, system or room?
- raw data must be properly *formatted* for storage, processing and presentation
	- ex: when dealing with sounds, videos or images
- accurate, relevant and timely info is key to good decision making
- Data management is the discipline that focuses on the proper generation, storage and retrieval of data

## Intro to DB:

- efficient data management typically requires the use of Computer DB
- DB - shared, integrated computer structure that stores a collection of
	- end user data
	- meta data
- metadata - describes the characteristics of data and the set of relationship that links the data
	- ex: schema
	- gives more idea about how to use the data
- database can be described as a collection of self describing data
- DBMS - is a collection of programs that manages the db structure and controls access to the data stored in the db
