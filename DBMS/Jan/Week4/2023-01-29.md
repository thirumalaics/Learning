## DBMS functions
- DBMS performs many fns including actions to ensure
	- integrity of data
	- consistency of data
- some ex fns:
	- data dict management
	- data storage management
	- data transformation and presentation
	- security management
	- multiuser control
	- backup and recovery management
	- data integrity management
	- database access languages
	- apis
	- db comms interface

### Data dict management
- definition of data elements and their relationships stored in data dictionary
- all prog that access data goes through the dbms
- dbms uses data dict to lookup data component structs and their relationships
- any change in the db structure are recorded in dbd
- removes structural and data dependence
	- as program have to navigate using the DBMS
	- programs do not have to change

### Data storage management
- DBMS creates and manages complex structures required for data storage
- we do not have to define and program the physical data characteristics
- a modern DBMS provides storage for:
	- data
	- related data entry forms or screen definitions
	- report definitions
	- data validation rules
	- procedural code
	- structures to handle video and picture formats
- very important for performance tuning
- DBMS stores data as many files
	- may even be distributed across disks
	- diferent storage mediums are possible as well
- DBMS can handle multiple requests

### Data Transformation and presentation
- DBMS transforms the inserted data to conform to the required data structure
- DBMS takes care of handling the physical data format
- every time DBMS formats the physically retrieved data to make it conform to the user's logical expectations
- For example, imagine an enterprise database used by a multinational company. An end user in England would expect to enter data such as July 11, 2010, as “11/07/2010.” In contrast, the same date would be entered in the United States as “07/11/2010.” Regardless of the data presentation format, the DBMS must manage the date in the proper format for each country.

### Security management
- DBMS creates a security sys that enforces security and data privacy
- provides access control
- provides proper authentication

### Multi user access control
- dbms uses sophisticated algos to ensure concurrent access without compromising integrity

### Backup and recovery management
- provided by DBMS
- provides utilities that allow DBA to perform periodic backups and recoveries
- some causes of failures: bad sector in disk, power issues

### Data integrity management
- promotes and enforces DI rules
- as a result reduces redundancy and maximizing consistency
- data relationships stored are used
- very imp in txn-oriented dbs

### DB access languages and APIs
- data access through query lang
	- non procedural
- DBMS also provides APIs to procedural langs like JAVA, Py
- administrative utilities provided to create, implement, monitor and maintain the db

### Database communication Interfaces
- accepts end user requests through multiple n/w envs
	- access to db using browsers
		- pre written programs which generate reports based on configs entered
	- broadcast info via email etc...

## Disadv of DBs:
- increased costs
	- sophisticated h/w, s/w
	- highly skilled personnel
- management complexities:
	- interfaces with many techs
	- security policies should be assessed frequently
- maintanence of the DBMS itself:
	- updates, patches - small these are
	- train personnel to be up to date with advancements in DBMS
- vendor dependence
	- not easy and expensive to switch vendors once personnel are competent with one
- frequent upgrade/replacement cycles
	- new s/w upgrades the vendor provides might require new h/w to use the fnalities
