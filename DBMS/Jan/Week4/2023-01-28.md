## DB sys env
- db sys is a organization of components
- these components define and regulate
	- collection
	- management
	- storage
	- usage
- from a general management point of view, the dbs is composed of the five major parts
![[Pasted image 20230128183850.png]]
1. H/w
2. S/w
3. People
4. procedures
5. data

### H/w
- all of system's physical devices
	- comp
	- printer
	- storage devices
	- n/w devices (hubs, switches)
	- others
### S/w
- most common is DBMS
- three types of S/W needed for a fully functional DBs:
	- OS s/w
	- DBMS
	- app programs and utilities

- OS: 
	- manages all h/w comp
	- makes it possible for other s/w to run on computers
	- ex: macOS,linux,MSW
- DBMS:
	- manages the db withing the dbs
	- ex: mysql, Oracle
- Application S/w and utilities
	- to access and manipulate data in dbms
	- also to manage the computer env in which data access and manipulation takes place
	- apps that are used to generate reports
	- utilities are s/w tools used to help manage the dbs's computer components
	- ex: GUI provided by DBMS vendors
### People
- all users of DBs
- five types of users based on job functions:
	- sys admins:
		- oversee the dbs's general ops
	- DB admins: ^65dc3b
		- manage db
		- ensure the functioning of the db
	- DB designers:
		- DB architects
		- core people
		- if design is bad, every other user gets affected
		- definition of this role expands
	- Sys analysts and programmers
		- design and implement the app programs
		- design and create
			- data entry screens
			- reports
			- procedures through which end users access and manipulate data
	- end users
		- people who use the app programs to run the org's daily ops
		- ex: sales clerks, supervisor, managers
		- high level end users make decision with the info

### Procedures
- instructions or rules
- govern the design and use of the dbs
- enforce standard by which business is conducted within the org and with customers
- also to ensure there is an organized way to monitor and audit data(that comes into the db) and info(that leaves the db)

### Data
- coll of facts
- db sys can be created and managed at diff levels of complexities and with varying adherence to stds.
