- knowledge of evolution of file system data processing can help in understanding the data access limitations that databse eliminates
- db makes it easier to create soln that avoid these probs

## Manual File Sys
- org should have systems handling core business tasks
- back in the days it way manual paper pen sys
- these papers were then organized for later use
- file folders and filing cabinet
- easy as long as less reporting requirements, data collection small
- as orgs grew, keeping track of these file became complex 

## Computerized File sys
- generating reports from manual file sys were slow and cumbersome

- when the users wanted data from computerized files:
	- sent request to DP specialist
	- for each req, DP specialist wrote program to retrieve data from a file
	- manipulate in whatever manner user wanted 
	- present it as printed report
- this type of system had a lot of redundant data
- each file in the system used it's own program to store, retrieve and modify data

- earlier, b4 CFS, users had access to their data but did not have tools to convert them to info
- CFS gave those tools but distanced the end users from the data
- desire to close the gap led to dev of many techs,sys design
	- created a split b/w the ways DP viewed the data and end users viewed the data
	- from dp perspective: the computer files were created identical to manual files. Data manage ment program were created to insert, update ,delete data from file
