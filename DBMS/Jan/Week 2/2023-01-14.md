#### extent of use
- now most popular classification
- how data will be used
- time sensitivity of info gathered from them
- database designed to support day to day operations is classified as operational/trans/production db
- dwh focuses on storing info needed to generate info to make strategical decisions
	- decisions need extensive data massaging/manipulation to bring out info needed for decisions
	- most decision support data is obtained from data collected from operational db over time
	- can store data collected from multiple sources
	- structure of dwh diff from odb
- unstructured data - data that exist within the original state(format in which they were collected)
	- cannot be directly used for processing that would result information
- structured data - result of formatting(structuring) unstructured data for use, storage and information generating
- the formating/structuring is applied based on the type of processing we intend to do on the data
- semistructured data - data that is processed to some extent
- unstructured and semistructured data storage and management are addressed by XML databases
- XML (extinsible markup language) - text based
	- semi structured

### database design:

- design of the db structure that would store and manage end-user data
- even a good dbms performs poorly with a badly designed db
- proper database design requires identification of db's expected use
- designing an operational db needs accurate, consistent data and operational speed
- designing an dwh needs use of historical and aggregated data
- integrated data must be first decomposed into specific parts
- the specific parts get their own table
- relationships b/w these tables must be carefully implemented
	- allowing the users to generate the integrated view again for information
