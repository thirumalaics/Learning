- goal of normalization is to reduce data redundancy 
- structure tables
- involves assigning attributes to tables based on concept of determination([[the relational database model]])
- normalization works through a series of stages called normal forms
	- 1NF
	- 2NF
	- 3NF
- from structural point of view 3NF>2NF>1NF
- mostly 3NF is as high as we need to go 
- highest level of normalization is not always the most desired
- higher the normal form, more the requirement for relational joins as a response to user queries
- best design is one that considers user's fast performance demand
- there will be needs to denormalize some parts of the database to meet the user performance needs
- **Denormalization** produces a lower form of normal form
- Meaning this increase data redundance while increasing the query performance by reducing the required relational joins
- normalization cares about relations
