## Conceptual Model
- graphically represented by an ERD
- can be implemented in any DBMS
	- DBMS independent
- to integrate all external views into a single view
	- entities, rl, constraints and processes
- represents a global view of the entire db as viewed by the entire org
- aka conceptual schema
- basis for the identification and high-level description of the main data objects(avoiding any db model-specific details)
- most widely used conceptual model is the ER model
- ER model illustrated with the help of the ERD
	- also the basic db blueprint
	- used to graphically represent the conceptual schema
- adv:
	- relatively easily understood bird's eye view of the data env
		- abstract
	- independent of both h/w and s/w
		- s/w dependence:
			- model does not depend on the DBMS s/w used to implement the model
		- h/w dependence
			- model does not depend on the h/w
- logical design: task of creating a conceptual data model

## Internal Model
- maps the conceptual model to the DBMS
- representation of the db as seen by the DBMS
- s/w dependent
- requires the designer to match the conceptual model's characteristics and constraints to those of the selected implementation model
- internal schema: specific representation of an internal model
	- using the db constructs supported by the chosen db
- in this book, a relational db was chosen to implement the internal model
	- internal schema will map the conceptual model to the relational model constructs
	- entities are mapped to tables in RM
	- internal schema is expressed using the SQL
- dev of detailed internal model is especially imp to db designers of hierarchical or n/w models
	- these models require very precise specification of data storage location and data access paths
- RM does not need this in IM
	- because most RDBMSs handle data access path definition transparently
	- RDBMS usually req data storage location spec
- when we can change the IM w/o affecting the CM, we have logical independence
- IM is still h/w-independent
	- change in storage devices or a change in OS will not affect IM
