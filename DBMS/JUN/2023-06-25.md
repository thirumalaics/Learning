## Keys
- in the RM, keys are imp
	- because they ensure unique row identification and data integrity
	- used to establish relationships among tables
- one or more attributes that determine other attributes
	- ex: an invoice number identifies all of the invoice attributes
- the key's role is based on a concept known as determination 
	- in the context of db table, the statement "A determines B"(A->B) indicates that if we know the value of attribute A, we can look up(determine) the value of attribute B
	- if A detemines B,C, D = A->B,C,D
- principle of determination is very important because it is used in the definition of a central RDB concept known as functional dependence
- functional dependence: the attribute B is functionally dependent on A if A determines B
- the attribute B is functionally dependent on the attribute A if each value in column A determines one and only one value in column B
- the functional dependence definition can be generalized to cover the case in which determining attribute values occur more than once in a table:
	- attribute A determines attribute B(that is, B is functionally dependent on A) if all of the rows in the table that agree in value for attribute A also agree in value for attribute B
- it can take more than a single attribute to define functional depenedence
	- meaning the key can contain more than one attribute
	- such multi attribute key can be called as composite key
	- any attribute part of a key is known as key attr
- how to express composite key:

- full functional dependence: 
	- if the attribute(B) is functionally dependent on a composite key(A) but not on any subset of that composite key, the attribute B is fully functionally dependent on A
- super key is any key that uniquely identifies each row
	- the super key functionally determines all of a row's attribute

- a candidate key can be described as a superkey without the unecessary attrs
	- minimal super key
