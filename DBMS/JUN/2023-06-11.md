## Physical Model
- lowest level of abstraction
- describes the way data are saved on storage media such as disks or tapes
- requires the definition of
	-  the physical storage devices
	- the physical access methods required to reach the data within those storage devices 
- PM is s/w and h/w dependent
- storage structures used are dependent on the s/w(OS and DBMS) and the type of storage devices that the computer can handle
- db designers working at this level should have a detailed knowledge of the h/w and s/w used to implements
- early data models **forced** the db designer to take the details of the PM's data storage requirements into account
- the RM is aimed largely at the logical rather than the physical level
	- does not **require** the physical-level details common to its predecessors
- implementation of a RM may require physical-level fine-tuning for increased performance
	- for large dbs
- even that physical-level finetuning does not require knowledge of physical data storage characteristics
- when we can change the physical model w/o affecting the internal model, we have physical independence
	- ex: change in storage devices or methods and even a change in OS will not affect the internal model

# CH3: RDBM
- RM based on set-theory and predicate logic
- predicate logic, in math, provides a FW in which an assertion(statement of fact) can be verified as either true or false
- set theory used as a basis for data manipulation in RM
- the RM has three well-defined components:
	- a logical data structure represented by relations
	- a set of integrity rules to enforce that the data are and remain consistent over time
	- a set of operations that defines how data are manipulated
