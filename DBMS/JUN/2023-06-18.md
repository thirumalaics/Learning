## A logical view of data
- DBMS manages and controls access to the data and the db structure
- placing the DBMS in between the app and the db eliminates most of the filesystem's inherent limitations
	- the result of such flexibility, however is a far more complex physical structure
- in fact, the db structures required by both the hierarchical and n/w db models often become complicated enough to diminish efficient db design
- the relational data model changed all of that by allowing the designer to focus on the logical representation of the data and its relationships, rather on the physical storage details
	- relational model enables us to view data logically rather than physically
- we can closely relate the logical view to the way in which we see the files
	- table does resemble a file from a conceptual point of view
	- although there are huge diff: adv of structural and data independence

### tables and their char
- logical view of the rdb is facilitated by the creation of data rl 
	- rl based on relation(logical construct)
	- can be thought of as a table
- we can think of a table as a persistent representation of a logical relation
	- a relation whose contents can be permanently saved for future use
- wrt to user, a table contains a group of related entity occurrences
	- entity set
- rm uses attr values to establish relationships among tables
	- relation does not mean relationships

- a column's range of permissible values is known as its domain
